# Videos: Intents

## Creating Intents

In this section, we discuss how to create an intent within the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) portion of  Amelia. It also discusses the different options within the intent section which can help to customize the intents.

## Training Intents

This video shows all the files that should be created to train an intent and reviews the best practices for creating them along with common issues to avoid. It then shows how those files are uploaded into Amelia and then how to create a model to train and deploy that training.

## Training Intents with LLMs

This video shows how you can create intents that are trained to recognize end user utterances by using Amelia’s built in LLMs. The key is naming the intents something that is snake cased and providing an accurate description along with enabling the intent training with LLMs in the settings. By being able to train intents with LLMs, it saves a tremendous amount of time in terms of getting the intents up and running and able to be used by our end users.

## Identifying and Building the Intent Scope

This video covers how the best practice is to combine intents that are similar and then use entities to separate the flows later.

## Training Data Sources

This video covers the importance of getting varied utterances to be able to recognize intents from our users who come from diverse backgrounds and might phrase things in unique ways. It also covers how actual agents or chat logs with your current customers would be an ideal source of data for training intents.

## Intent Training - Best Practices

In this video we show how to avoid common issues of adding noise to training utterances or how overfitting can create problems for intent recognition.

## Exercise - Train Intents

This is an entire walkthrough on the purpose of intents, how to build properly formatted training files for them and how to make sure everything is properly linked, trained, and tested.

## Machine Learning

This video covers how we train the models to be able to recognize the intents properly given the training data along with how metrics such as F1 scores are calculated.

## Intent FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

In Amelia, intents are recognized at a higher level than FAQs are. This section covers how for some companies whose FAQs are a substantial portion of what they want Amelia implemented to handle, we can create intent FAQs that are trained alongside other intents.

## Clarifying Question Asker (CQA)

The CQA is a built-in responder in Amelia’s brain that helps to clarify which intent the user means. It is useful for confusing utterances such as “I would like to reset my guest Wi-Fi password” if there is a use case on reset password and guest Wi-Fi. Users can choose the level they set this to along with even being able to turn it off as well.
