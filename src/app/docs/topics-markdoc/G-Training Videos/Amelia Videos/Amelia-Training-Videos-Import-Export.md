# Videos: Import and Export


## Import and Export Options

This video covers the different ways you can clean, import and export the work you have in one domain or instance into another. This can be useful for taking work with you after training as well as for how to move work you have from one instance to another when your company upgrades its current instance but wants to keep a backup option.
