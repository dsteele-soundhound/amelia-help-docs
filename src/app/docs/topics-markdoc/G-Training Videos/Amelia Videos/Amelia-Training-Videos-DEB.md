# Videos: Digital Employee Builder (DEB)


## Introduction

In this video, we will take a look at the basic functionality of Amelia's Digital Employee Builder. We will also learn more about using the Digital Employee Builder (DEB); how all the blocks are used, what the common blocks are, and how we can use Intents, Entities and other items within our conversational flows as well as adding generic questions and other information, adding to the content management system and much more.

## Say and Ask Blocks

In this video, we will learn more about how the Say block delivers informative messages, while the Ask block empowers you to pose generic or entity-specific questions, ensuring dynamic and engaging user interactions.

## Ask for the entity

This video covers how we can ask for entities in customized ways including the defaults built-in, how to customize them and the best practices when asking for entities.

## Service Prefixes - entity:

In this video, we cover all the built-in ways to extract or validate responses using the entity prefix. This can be used either within our valid, invalid or idk branches or in separate branches that might be used to split a flow depending on the value of a valid response.

## Content Manager

In this video, we will explore the Content Manager, a dynamic tool empowering Amelia to store and display user-uploaded files, documents, and diverse content, enhancing interactions by allowing users to access, download, or view information based on defined rules and conditions.

## Present Block

In this video, we will learn more about the Present Block, which enables showcasing files to users, whether it is images from local storage or information they gave Amelia, most commonly in a previous request block.

## Amelia Asks a Yes/No Question

In this video, we will discover how to optimize question design by using generic inquiries for simple yes or no responses, sidestepping the complexities of multiple Booleans or entities and ensuring smoother interactions and more accurate outcomes.

## Service Prefix - response:

In this video, we cover all the built-in ways to extract or validate responses using the response prefix, which is like the entity prefix but handles cases where Amelia does not need to store the information. This can be used either within our valid, invalid or idk branches or in separate branches that might be used to split a flow depending on the value of a valid response.

## Sub Flow Block

In this video, we will learn how using the sub flow block can allow you to have different implementation specialists working on different portions of the conversational flow at the same time along with testing smaller portions more quickly and allowing for reusable code that does not have to be recreated.
