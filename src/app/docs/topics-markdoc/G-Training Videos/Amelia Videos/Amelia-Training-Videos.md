# Amelia 6.x Training Videos

Welcome to our Amelia Training Videos. The videos on this page cover the initial topics from our Enablement course.

In this video series, we cover the core of what our enablement training offers to clients. This includes overviews about key features and how the system works along with full walkthroughs about how to train intents, entities, and other natural language understanding (NLU) features.

Additionally, we have several full walkthroughs of use cases that can provide hands-on examples of how to create a digital employee in Amelia  including scripts for customizations and an API call with our web actions.  Finally, we cover how we are using large language models (LLMs) in version 6 of Amelia.

## Amelia and Conversational AI

This overview covers how Amelia has evolved over the years to become a market-leading conversation AI platform that allows our clients to quickly create digital employees that can handle the most common tasks your customer service and internal help desks traditionally assist with. Amelia provides newer features like Amelia Builds Amelia to allow clients to very quickly have a template for whatever use case they’re interested in and then the ability to customize that employee to their needs while integrating with their backend systems.

It also includes large language models in v6 to better respond to a variety of utterances for frequently asked questions and to understand a user’s intents without having to train models.

## Welcome

In this video, we will provide an overview of the learning objectives and topics covered in this video series.

## Demonstration Conversational AI

In this walkthrough, we demonstrate how Amelia works for end users by showing how they would interact with Amelia in the event they lost their card.

This will show the information that Amelia needs to gather from the user and how it can take them through ensuring there wasn’t fraud, cancelling their lost card and ordering a new card.

## First Exercise: Amelia as HR Specialist

In this video we cover if you have 60 to 90 minutes with a subject matter expert (SME), how you can build an entire conversational flow that automates the task of onboarding new employees.

## Concepts & Terminology

In this video, we cover the key concepts and terminology that will be used throughout the course including instances, domains, intents, entities, and utterances.

## General Amelia Conversation Flow

This video gives an overview of how Amelia is working to recognize the intent of an end user’s utterance and then choose whether to respond to their FAQ, take them through an entire conversational flow or have one of the other subsystems respond to the user. It also shows how once that is finished, Amelia goes back to using its intelligent arbitration system to recognize what the next utterance of the user is if they need multiple questions answered or intent flows responded to.

## Intelligent Arbitration and Sub Systems

This shows all the different sub systems that are built into Amelia to not only respond to users who have frequently asked questions or conversational flows but also to respond to any type of utterances the user has while tracking their satisfaction with the process throughout.

## Affective Memory

This video covers the affective memory portion of Amelia’s brain, which tracks the user’s satisfaction and overall mood throughout the entire conversation. This score can be used within conversational flows or in other ways as well.

## Training Use Case

This video gives an overview of the different intents that we will train with Amelia and how Amelia recognizes the difference between them based on utterances from the end user.

## Frequently Asked Questions With LLMs

The FAQs have been enhanced to allow you to either have Amelia reach out to our LLMs whenever a frequently asked question is asked or to instead choose to have the LLMs add additional pairs when creating the QA pairs. This does require the domain to be configured to use Amelia’s LLMs along with ensuring that the proper subsystems are setup but it can increase the number of utterances from our end users that will properly map to the FAQs and it can also even provide you with sourcing material and scores for how close a match it is.

## Amelia Builds Amelia (ABA)

Amelia Builds Amelia (ABA) is the featured item that comes with version 6 of  Amelia. ABA allows a conversational designer to take advantage of advanced prompt engineering to have chatGPT build a conversational flow that will drastically reduce the time it takes to create and test a conversational flow. It creates a full conversational flow for users that includes the different blocks used within our digital employee builder (DEB) flows and it also adds conditional logic to branch the flows when appropriate and even comes with placeholders for backend API integrations that are created with mock outputs for testing purposes.
