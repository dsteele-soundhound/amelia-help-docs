# Navigate Amelia's Product Support

## Introduction

Amelia's Product Support portal now has self-service capabilities, including "live requests," which involve conversations with Amelia. The process is end-to-end automated with Amelia guiding you through the steps. To access self-service support for Amelia, you'll visit support.amelia.com. Here, you'll find a wide range of resources as follows:

* Domain Creation
* Domain Modification
* User Creation
* Permission Change
* Password Reset
* Generalized Ticket Creation, Status Retrieval, or Modification

The benefits of using Amelia's Product Support portal are significant. You don't need to fill in forms; instead, a quick conversation with Amelia creates a new ticket in Autonomics. After that, you can check back in with Amelia as often as you like to get updates on the status of your ticket. Amelia is available round-the-clock. This means that you have access to support when and where you need it. Amelia is extensively trained to gather all the required details and complete the necessary steps to fulfill your request. This ensures your request is well handled, and you have the best possible experience.

But don't worry; in-person help is here to stay! If you have ongoing challenges, you can contact an Amelia expert or send an email to open a support ticket.

## What You'll Learn

In this topic you'll learn how to access the Amelia Product Support portal.

## Access the Product Support Portal

As an employee, you have access to the Amelia Product Support portal by default. If you haven't logged in before, you can log in to get access, and Amelia creates your account automatically. As a client, you'll contact your Engagement Manager or Project Manager for access to support.amelia.com.

> If you need access to any other domain, see our How-to: Request a User Account Permission Change. Once you've raised the request, Amelia creates a ticket and processes it further.

To access the Amelia's Product Support portal:

1. Using **Google Chrome**, go to [https://support.amelia.com](https://support.amelia.com/).

2. At the **Login** screen, enter your **Email** and **Password**.

3. Click **Login**.

Inside Amelia's Product Support portal, you'll see a live chat panel on the left and an Info panel on the right. The Info panel has expandable groups for Top Requests, Request Details and Open Tickets. Using Top Requests is a great way to kick off a self-service support session with Amelia.

## Best Practices

To make the best use of Amelia's Product Support portal:
* Make prompts clear, concise, and specific.
* How you organize information matters. Telling Amelia the task to be accomplished first and then giving details works best. Otherwise, Amelia collects details before understanding how they relate to the task.
* Give Amelia time to respond with an answer.
* Have all necessary requirements available in advance of your conversation with Amelia. Each How-to that follows, will list the requirements that you'll need.
