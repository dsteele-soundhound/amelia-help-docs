# Amelia Platform Introduction

## Introduction

The Amelia platform pairs Generative AI and LLMs with a cognitive engine. This pairing helps you to build and deploy intelligent virtual agents faster. These virtual agents drive business value by improving user experience and optimizing operations.

### Generative AI and Conversational AI

Generative AI and Conversational AI have distinct attributes suited to different applications. Conversational AI handles natural language queries in real time, extracting relevant details and performing actions. This makes it ideal for customer service interactions, order processing, and FAQs (frequently asked questions).

Generative AI creates new contextually accurate and semantically consistent sentences and paragraphs. This skill makes Generative AI a powerful tool for creative and innovative tasks. Amelia uses Generative AI for various tasks. For example, zero-shot intent recognition and entity extraction. Amelia can also paraphrase and generate natural language responses. Plus, build complete prototypes with placeholders for key integrations. This helps you quickly implement new use cases.

LLMs (Large Language Models) are a type of Generative AI. LLMs are ideal for answering infrequently asked questions. Infrequently asked questions are specific and unexpected. LLMs also work well for agent recommendations during escalations. They can also summarize information for support agents. They use information from documents, knowledge stores, websites, and approved content. This provides accurate answers to specific questions. LLMs also make it possible to have natural and free-flowing conversations with documents. Your users can interact with documents in a more dynamic and interactive way.

Enterprises must exercise caution when deploying LLMs. As Generative AI gains popularity, hallucinations, bias, misinformation, and surveillance incidents are possible. When implemented correctly, this technology can bring tremendous value to your organization. The key lies in incorporating Generative AI into existing processes.

The true power of AI happens when you combine these technologies. Combining Conversational AI and Cognitive AI capabilities creates a superior experience. You get more functionality and better performance. This blend of AI technologies offers more sophisticated, intuitive, and personalized interactions. These interactions improve business operations and enhance customer satisfaction, driving business growth.

### Common Amelia Use Cases

User experience matters now more than ever. Today's enterprises face the pressures of customer expectations, employee dissatisfaction, and overall responsiveness. Because of these challenges, enterprises are speeding up their digital transformations.

The main reasons to choose Amelia are:

### Pillars of the Amelia Platform

The Amelia Conversational AI platform has three main pillars: Build with AI, Experience with AI, and Optimize with AI.

* **Build**: Helps you build solutions using Amelia's low-code design tool with built-in Generative AI. For AI-assisted design, you'll use the Digital Employees builder and Amelia Builds Amelia. You'll leverage pre-built content, natural language understanding and low-code integration and orchestration.
* **Experience**: Helps you captivate customers and employees with fast and personalized resolutions. For AI-enabled engagement, you'll use Amelia's Arbitration Engine. This offers multi-modal interactions and LLM-powered question-answering. It also provides intelligence, comprehension, escalation, and agent assistance.
* **Optimize**: This is key to learning, continuous improvement and adaptability. Sentient provides AI-driven deep analytics and insights for inductive learning. It also provides conversational, CSAT (Customer Satisfaction), and journey analytics.

### Amelia's Intelligent Virtual Agents

Powered by the latest AI technologies, Amelia's IVAs (Intelligent Virtual Agents) are a software that's always available to help your customers and employees. Amelia AI Agents communicate in natural language to answer questions and solve issues. Our AI Agents typically fall into three categories:

* **Answer Agents**: Virtual agents powered by Amelia Answers are great at instant information discovery. When information is hard to find, customers and employees become frustrated. Answer Agents solve this problem. These agents gather information from various sources, such as knowledge bases, websites, and documents. Then, they use AI techniques to quickly provide accurate answers to people's questions.
* **Action Agents**: Virtual agents powered by Amelia Actions excel at seamless task resolution. Contact centers and support teams are often short-staffed and busy, causing long wait times. Action Agents ease the pressure on contact centers by automating tasks. Built on the Amelia Actions (Amelia Builds Amelia) platform, these AI agents have thousands of skills and can learn new ones. They also use Generative AI to uncover new use cases and improve experiences.
* **Autonomous Agents**: This is the future of AI. These agents combine Amelia Answers and Amelia Actions with cutting-edge AI research. Autonomous Agents make it even easier to build and scale. Autonomous Agents don't need step-by-step configuration. They receive instructions and expectations, and they figure out the rest.
