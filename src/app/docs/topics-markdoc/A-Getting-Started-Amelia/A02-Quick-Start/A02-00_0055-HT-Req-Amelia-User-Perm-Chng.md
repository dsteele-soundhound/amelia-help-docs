# How-to: Request a User Permission Change

## Introduction

Amelia's Product Support portal now has self-service capabilities. The process is end-to-end automated with Amelia guiding you through the steps. The benefits of Amelia's Product Support portal are significant. You don't need to fill in forms; instead, a quick conversation with Amelia creates a new ticket in Autonomics. After that, you can check back in with Amelia as often as you like to get updates on the status of your ticket. Amelia is available round the clock.

As your team expands and your projects develop, you'll need added permissions in Amelia. Initiating a request for changes to one or many user accounts is now just a short conversation away. To access self-service support for Amelia, visit support.amelia.com.
