# Light and Dark Mode

## Introduction

The Amelia application offers two modes for displaying content and data. You can choose between a light mode theme or dark mode theme. It's your choice which one you prefer. Light mode displays text with a white background. Dark mode displays with a black background. Light mode is bright and clear. Dark mode is more calming and easy on the eyes. In addition, offering both modes can help with accessibility.

Amelia also offers an easy way to edit the color scheme and other visual elements. The Themes feature lets you edit an existing theme or create new ones from scratch. See the [Themes Introduction](B01-04_0401-Themes-Intro.md) topic for details on how it works.
