# Amelia and Responsible AI

## Introduction

An AI (artificial intelligence) is a powerful tool that can make decisions, automate tasks, or analyze huge amounts of data. While this can be useful, it's crucial to handle AI responsibly to avoid problems.

Responsible AI means designing and using AI systems in ways that are ethical, fair, and safe.

In general, Amelia is a highly supervised AI solution. The software is as responsible as the human implementation teams make it. Amelia is as responsible as your business processes. However, Responsible AI is a more complicated topic which covers the issues below.

* [Transparency](#Transparency).
* [Accountability](#Accountable).
* [Privacy and Security](#Privacy).
* [Human Oversight](#Human).
* [The Impact of Generative AI](#Impact).

## Fairness {% #Fairness %}

Fairness ensures that AI systems treat all individuals fairly. Fairness avoids discrimination or bias based on characteristics such as race, gender, or ethnicity.

Amelia treats everybody the same unless programmed to handle different groups differently. For example, working with groups of people who need a password reset versus people requesting an insurance quote. However, there is no inherent bias built into Amelia.

##Transparency {% #Transparency %}

Transparency makes AI systems more interpretable and understandable to users and stakeholders. It allows people to understand how the AI arrives at its decisions.

Amelia is transparent and not a black box. For example, our Predict tool and other interfaces show how the software arrives at conclusions. These tools configure and train Amelia. They also provide transparency for responsible AI purposes.

##Accountability {% #Accountable %}

Accountability involves establishing mechanisms to trace the decisions made by AI systems. It takes responsibility for the outcomes they produce.

Amelia really does not make those types of decisions. The software does decide user intent. However, determining user intent isn't an accountable decision. Instead, Amelia makes these decisions based upon rules defined by human engineers. Or uses an external decision support system. Amelia could feed information to that system. But the business decision and accountability are in the human-defined rules. Or a decision support system.

##Privacy and Security {% #Privacy %}

Privacy and security involve safeguarding user data. And ensuring AI systems follow all relevant data protection regulations.

Amelia has all the certifications for privacy and data protection.

##Human Oversight {% #Human %}

Human oversight ensures full control of an AI system. Plus, the ability to intervene if necessary.

Human supervisors use Amelia's extensive toolset to track and control Amelia's interactions.

##The Impact of Generative AI {% #Impact %}

Generative AI is an integral part of Amelia, since 2020. It's used for different purposes. For example, to improve Amelia's natural language understanding and comprehension. It also helps create use cases by paraphrasing then building process flows. Human experts supervise the results.

Developments since GPT3 and ChatGPT create new use cases for unsupervised operation. This can affect Transparency and Accountability. Carefully consider these effects when using generative models.

Amelia's has only a few unsupervised use cases. The Humanizer responder uses an LLM and might generate unintentional responses. The FAQ/Question answering system also generates answers with LLMs. Inputs are corporate information and the user questions. While performance is generally good, these are unsupervised use cases. However, human experts use Amelia's extensive toolset to supervise the results.
