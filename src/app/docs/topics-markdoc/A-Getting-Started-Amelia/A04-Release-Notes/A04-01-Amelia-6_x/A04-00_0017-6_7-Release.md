##  Release Highlights

### Amelia Answers {id="amelia-answers_1"}

#### Test Suite Now SupportsTesting of Amelia Answers Deployments

Amelia is expanding the ability to test Amelia Answers deployments using the Amelia Answers Tests Suite. Amelia had expanded the Test Suite to test responses from LLMs powered by Knowledge Source Segments in addition to QA Pairs. However, those responses didn't contain information about the leveraged sources and segments in the Test Report. Amelia now provides detailed information about the main Source and Segment leveraged to generate the response. Users can also understand what documents and sources will be displayed to end users via the citation modal. This is in addition to the specific response. (AM5-10836)

### Core Agent View {id="core-agent-view_1"}

#### Agent Responses Now Supports RTF

Agents responding to users within the Agent View portal can provide context to their responses via Rich Text Formatting. When creating responses, Agents can bold, italicize, and underline specific sections of their responses. This provides contextual information highlighting specific elements of their response. This allows agents to now match the formatting provided by the Amelia Chat Bot Responses. (AM5-11267)

#### "Hey Amelia" Now a Dedicated Widget

Amelia is moving our Agent Facing Automations Feature 'Hey Amelia.' It is now a dedicated widget within the Agent View interface. Supervisors can specify Conversational Flows that Agents can trigger in a conversation. Agents are then able to view, search, and trigger those flows via the Hey Amelia widget. This improves discoverability of agent automations. It also decreases the amount of work that Agents need to do to resolve routine tasks on behalf of clients. (AM5-10925)

#### Categorize Response Templates Added

In the Agent View, customer service agents can select from multiple Response Templates. These templates are set up by agents and their supervisors to provide a quick brand appropriate response. When the number of Response Templates grows, identifying the correct template becomes a time consuming task. With improved categorization and discoverability tooling, Agents and Supervisors are now able to Tag and Title specific response templates. They also can search these fields, reducing the time agents need to respond to customers in a brand appropriate fashion. (AM5-11270, AM5-11556, AM5-11557)

#### Suggested Response Templates Added

In the Agent View, customer service agents can select from multiple Response Templates. These templates are set up by agents and their supervisors to provide a quick brand appropriate response. When the number of Response Templates grows, identifying the correct template becomes a time consuming task. Now, upon every conversational turn, Amelia will identify the most appropriate templates and surface them to the agent. Templates appear near the text input. This reduces the time agents need to respond to customers in a brand appropriate fashion. (AM5-11271)

#### Attributable Resolution Plans Added

In the Agent View console, Agents now have access to attributable resolution plans. Agents can summarize a conversation with AI within the Conversation Information widget. The Resolution Plan that's generated will leverage Agent Knowledge Sources set up within Amelia Answers to create resolution plans. These plans are grounded in SOPs and documentation that the Agent can access. These resolution plans help agents quickly understand the customers' problem and walk through the steps needed to resolve it. Now they can easily access the underlying documentation used to generate the plan. (AM5-11272)

### Gateway Service

#### Web Messaging API Suite Now With Genesys Web Messaging

Amelia is moving our Genesys channels from the Guest Chat API suite to the Web Messaging API Suite. This is in response to Genesys' announcement that they will be deprecating the Guest Chat API suite at the end of 2024. This ensures that service within the Escalation Gateway will continue as normal without interruption for end-users past the 2024 date. (AM5-10454)

| Knowledge Source Error Messaging (AM5-10803)                         | Amelia Answers are living documents continuously updated with new information. The user interface used to give little sign if the documents were changing or if any errors occurred. This meant that some issues went unnoticed and unresolved. Now, Amelia highlights any knowledge sources with warnings or errors in the Sources panel. This small change makes identifying and resolving specific issues with knowledge sources easier. As an end user, you will receive accurate and up-to-date Amelia Answers. As a creator, you can now identify and resolve issues before they become problems for users. |
| Track Sources and Segments Directly in the Testing Suite (AM5-10836) | When building out Amelia Answers, creators can let end-users see where the answers come from. However, this information is unavailable in the testing report. As a result, users need to manually test Amelia Answers to include the source information in their test results. Now, Amelia provides the specific sources and segments used within the test report. Users can explore these results in the Amelia UI or export them to analyze them further in a CSV file. This improvement ensures that users consistently receive reliable and accurate Amelia Answers implementations. It also lets creators address any unexpected answers generated using the Amelia Answers pipeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
