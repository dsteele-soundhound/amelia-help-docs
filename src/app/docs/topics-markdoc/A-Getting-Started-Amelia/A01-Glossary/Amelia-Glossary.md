### LDAP

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open cross platform protocol used for directory services authentication. LDAP is a language applications use to communicate with directory services to authenticate users.

### LLM

A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained with self-supervised machine learning on a vast amount of text. LLMs are designed for natural language processing tasks, especially language generation.

With the Amelia 7 release, LLMs help process and complete conversations. LLMs extract user intent, identify entity data needed to complete their intent, and process user utterances to facilitate conversation. The Orchestrator uses LLMs to perform these tasks and provide data. The Orchestrator uses this data to work with Cognitive Functions and Knowledge Collections.

With earlier versions of Amelia, LLMs create models which help identify user intent and capture entity data needed to complete user intents.



### LP

### MIME

MIME (Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an extension of the original Internet e-mail protocol to let people exchange different kinds of data files on the Internet, for example, audio, video, images, application programs, and other kinds, as well as the ASCII text handled in the original protocol.

### Models

A model is a program trained to recognize patterns or make decisions without human intervention. Artificial intelligence models use algorithms and data to perform specific tasks. Amelia identifies intents and entities either by training a model or using an LLM (large language model).

Training a model uses intents, entities, and other data to create a representational model about a topic. Words and phrases in the model will or won't match words in conversations. Matches indicate an entity or intent exists in a conversation. Amelia includes built-in machine learning algorithms used to train models. Amelia uses the model to parse real-time conversations.

### Negative Utterances

An unlabeled training utterance, negatives help Amelia learn the difference between tasks and knowledge she is trained on and things she is not. They help Amelia understand words that are similar but have different unrelated meanings than utterances used to trigger the intent goal and Amelia’s processes.

### NER

Named Entity Recognition is part of extracting information to locate named entity mentions in unstructured text then classify the entities into categories, for example, person names, organizations, and date/time expressions.

### NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) mixes computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence to program computers to analyze and understand natural human language, the unconstructed casual way people talk.

### NPE

NullPointerException is a Java RuntimeException. In Java, a special null value can be assigned to an object reference. A NullPointerException is thrown when an application attempts to use an object reference that has the null value.

### NLU

NLU (Natural Language Understanding) software is AI software that enables computers to understand and interpret human language, both text and speech. It goes beyond simply processing words. It focuses on understanding the meaning, context, and intent behind the language used by humans. This allows machines to not only recognize the words but also to grasp the underlying meaning and sentiment. This enables more natural and intelligent human-computer interactions.

### Orchestrator

With the Amelia 7 release, an Orchestrator manages conversations. It uses LLMs, knowledge sources, and functions to identify user intent, capture information needed from the user, perform tasks, and provide information.

For example, if a customer wants to return a sweater, the Amelia 7 Orchestrator manages these resources:

* **LLMs** to parse the user conversation to identify their goal, to return a sweater. The LLMs also capture information about the sale and the product involved. And the LLM helps parse the user conversation throughout to convey information. For example, to answer follow-up questions.
* **Cognitive Functions** to take sale information then confirm the sale happened. The function queries the customer database to confirm a sale. And then queries a product database to confirm the product exists.
* **Knowledge Collections** to tell the user about return policies.
