# Event Attributes Walkthrough

## Introduction

Attributes let you identify and organize events based on specific criteria. For example, a configuration item or resource. Once you organize events using attributes, you can then perform actions. An attribute to identify databases in a location might be rebooted at a set time. Or rebooted when one of the databases does not respond to a heartbeat signal.

Once created, you can assign an attribute to all appropriate resources.

The [Event Management Introduction](E04-02_0002-Event-Mgmnt-Mod-Intro.md) topic describes how to use rules, attributes, and correlations.

## What You'll Learn

In this topic you'll learn about:

* [The Attributes workspace](#Workspace).

* [Adding an event attribute](#AddAttribute).

* [Deleting an event attribute](#UpdateAttribute).

* [Best practices for creating and using attributes](#BestPractices)

## The Attributes Workspace {% #Workspace %}

The Attributes feature includes several workspaces:

* A default workspace that lists all available attributes with tools to search, create, and edit individual attributes.

* A right side panel that displays details about a specific attributes and configure new attributes.

### The Default Workspace

The first workspace you'll see is the list of attributes. These are sorted by client and by any search terms. This includes tools to create new attributes.

### The Right Side Panel

When you select an attribute in the default list workspace, details about the attribute displays in a right side panel. Clicking the **+ Add New button** in the default workspace also displays the right side panel. When you open this panel, the + Add New button changes to a + button.

## Best Practices {% #BestPractices %}
