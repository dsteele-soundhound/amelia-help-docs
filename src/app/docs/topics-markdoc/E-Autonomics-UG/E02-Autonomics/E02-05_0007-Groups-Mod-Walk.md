## The User Groups Workspace {% #Workspace %}

The User Groups workspace lets you create groups. You can assign user accounts to these groups. Then assign the groups to provide access to IT resources using the Passwords feature.

There are several workspaces and panels:

* The default workspace lists user groups. You can search for groups and create new groups.

* The right-side properties panels let you create and manage user groups and their user accounts. A right-side panel also lets you add users to individual groups.


### The Default Workspace

The default workspace lists all user groups. You also can use this workspace to search for a group and create new user groups.

### The Right-Side Panels

The right-side panel displays after you click a user group name in the default workspace. The panel displays the selected user account details. Clicking the Edit button at the bottom right of the panel displays user group data in a form.

The user group right-side panels let you add groups and their users.

* The group properties panel displays the group name with a button to add users.

* When you click the + Add User button at the bottom of the properties panel, the Add Users panel displays. The group properties panel slides to the left while the Add Users panel displays on the right side of the workspace.
