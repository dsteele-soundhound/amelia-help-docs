# Allowed Commands Management

## Introduction

Some Autonomics commands can run automatically when executed by an automation. They do not request user confirmation to execute. The Allowed Commands workspace lets you create and manage these commands.

* Only users with the necessary permissions can add, update, or delete commands in the list of allowed commands.

  Users must be assigned these permissions: IPautomata Allowed Command Admin, IPautomata Allowed Command Execute, IPautomata Allowed Command Update, and IPautomata Allowed Command View.
* Automations will execute allowed commands without prompting the user for confirmation. Automations trigger when the Resolve with AI button is clicked in a Task workspace.

* Commands not in the Allowed Commands workspace will prompt the user before they execute. User prompt options are Yes, No, or Always. Selecting Always will add the command to the allowed commands. These commands will execute without confirmation in the future.

## Access the Allowed Commands Workspace

To access the Allowed Commands workspace:

1. Using Amelia's top left main menu, click Autonomics.
2. Using the Autonomicstop left main menu, click Autonomics.
3. Click the Browser link on the left side, below the logo, and select the Allowed Commands link.

Click any Allowed Command to view its detail page with the ability to edit or delete the command.
