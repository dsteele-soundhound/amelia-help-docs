# Scheduling Module Introduction

## Introduction

The Scheduling module lets you schedule one-off or recurring events. The module provides an easy to use calendar view to manage events. You also can filter events by one or more types, for example, Automations or Tasks. Or Automations, Tasks, and Hypera events. And you can sort by one or more Users. The calendar view also lets you view events by month or week. And you can go forwards or backwards by month or week.
