# Denied Commands Management

## Introduction

Some Autonomics commands can run automatically when executed by an automation. They do not request user confirmation to execute. The Denied Commands workspace lets you create and manage these commands.

* Only users with the necessary permissions can add, update, or delete commands in the list of Denied Commands.

  Users must be assigned these permissions: IPautomata Denied Command Admin, IPautomata Denied Command Execute, IPautomata Denied Command Update, and IPautomata Denied Command View.

* Automations will execute Denied Commands without prompting the user for confirmation. Automations trigger when the Resolve with AI button is clicked in a Task workspace.

* Commands not in the Denied Commands workspace will prompt the user before they execute. User prompt options are Yes, No, or Always. Selecting Always will add the command to the Denied Commands. These commands will execute without confirmation in the future.

1. Using Amelia's top left main menu, click Autonomics.
