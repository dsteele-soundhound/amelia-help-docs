# Connections Module Introduction

## Introduction

The Connections module gives you a broad flexible range of connectivity options. It lets you connect with many resources and configuration items (CIs). You can use tags to organize connections and resources. And Automata Lite instances can use these connections to work with resources and CIs.

You can connect with DB2, MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and Teradata databases. Connectivity tools include PowerShell, SSH, PowerShell Over SSH, and Telnet. The module also supports PowerBroker to manage commands used with resources.

The Connections module also includes a command line interface (CLI). It displays as a web page with a Terminal tab and a Log tab.

The [Connections Management](E02-04_0004-Connections-Mgmnt.md) topic explains how to configure Connections. And the [Connections Sessions Walkthrough](E02-04_0003-Connection-Sessions-Walk.md) describes how to initiate and manage sessions.
