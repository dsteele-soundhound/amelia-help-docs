### Create and Manage Automations

The workflow for creating and managing your automations is a multi-step process. You'll start by identifying potential candidates for automation. When identifying potential candidates, look for recurring issues to partially or entirely automate. These issues can exist across servers or on a specific server.

Next, you'll check for any existing automations to avoid creating duplicates. You can create custom automations using Automation Studio. With its drag-and-drop interface, you need minimal coding experience. Or, you can use generative AI to quickly generate automations using your customers' runbooks and standard operating procedures. Pulling from various IT service management and knowledge management platforms natively integrated with Autonomics is the key.

Last, you'll test, promote, and schedule your automation. You also have the ability to roll back and optimize your automations.

### Automations Module User Experience
