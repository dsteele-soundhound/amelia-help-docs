## Introduction

Amelia Autonomics includes seamless native integration with a wide range of enterprise tools. This includes ServiceNow®. You get enhanced flexibility and expanded automation capabilities across your IT ecosystem. Equipped with pre-built plug-and-play integrations, Autonomics easily connects to essential platforms. This includes OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Office 365 Mail, Google Mail, Confluence, Zabbix, and others.

These integrations work out of the box. You'll need minimal developer skills to set up and manage. IT teams can quickly deploy and benefit from Amelia's automation capabilities. Without the need for custom development or extensive training.

In addition, Autonomics includes robust support for standard webhooks. These provide real-time notifications as events occur or new data points and metrics appear. Real-time updates ensure that Autonomics stays in perfect sync with integrated platforms. IT teams gain immediate insights and notifications crucial for responsive incident management. By eliminating complex polling mechanisms, webhook support simplifies event-driven integration. It enables real-time responsiveness. And reduces the load on both system resources and developers.

Beyond notifications, Autonomics uses webhook-triggered events to fuel its automation workflows. Events initiate the appropriate responses, from triaging incidents to deploying remediations. Raising a high-priority ServiceNow® ticket can trigger Autonomics to triage and prioritize it using pre-defined SOPs. Without human intervention.

Automating these responses lets your IT teams maintain high levels of service continuity. It also minimizes response times and reduces the burden of repetitive tasks.

Our [Integrations Management](E05-01_0011-Integrations-Mngmnt.md) topic describe how to access the Autonomics integration features. And our [Integrations Introduction](E05-01_0010-Integrations-Mod-Intro.md) topic describes how the Integration module works.
