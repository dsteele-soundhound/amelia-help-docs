# Themes Walkthrough

## Introduction

With the 3.12.0 release, Autonomics lets you create themes. Themes let you control the logo used to display an Autonomics instance. You can assign one or more themes to use with a virtual host configuration.

See the [Virtual Hosts Walkthrough topic](E05-01_0042-VirtualHosts-Walkthrough.md) for details about assigning a theme.


## Access the Themes Workspace

To access the Themes workspace:

1. Click the main navigation menu at the top left and hover over the **Administration** label. To view the **Themes** link, hover over the **Settings** label that displays.

2. Click the **Themes** link to display the module workspace that lists available themes.

> Already working in the Settings workspaces? Click the **Themes** link that appears in a drop down list at the top left, under the logo. This lets you work with the Users module, for example, then switch to working with the Themes module.
