# Authorities List

## Introduction

When a user logs in, they're assigned to a group. Every group is a set of authorities. Each authority lets you perform an action or view something within Amelia. Unlike users and groups, you cannot configure authorities.

## Accessing Authorities

You can assign authorities in the User Groups and Global User Groups workspaces. Each has an Authorities tab where you can add or remove authorities for a group.

To access the User Groups or Global User Groups workspace:

{% include from="B01-02_0102-UsersAccess.md" element-id="B01-02_0102-UsersAccess_snippet" /%}

3. From the flyout menu, select the **User Groups link** or **Global User Groups** link.

4. In the left side panel, click the **+ Add New button** or the name of an existing group. A tab workspace displays on the right side. Click its **Authorities tab** to see authorities.
