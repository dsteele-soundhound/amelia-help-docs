# User Groups Walkthrough

## Introduction

User groups organize a set of users, roles, and authorities within a specific domain. For example, groups collect many users and one or more roles and authorities. Membership in a group shares access rights and authorities needed to perform tasks. While you can add users to groups, you cannot add users to roles. User groups also exist at the domain level, not global.
