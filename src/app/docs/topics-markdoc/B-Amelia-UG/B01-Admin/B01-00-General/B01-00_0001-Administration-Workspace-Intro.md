# Administration Workspace Introduction

## Introduction

The Administration Home tab workspace offers features to set up an Amelia instance.Â Administration-related links also are on the left side panel navigation. Clicking these left side panel links displays flyout menus with feature options. For example, you can configure domains, add users, and set up authentication systems.

How the Administration workspaces work depends largely on your organization's goals. Our [Administration Workspace Walkthrough](B01-00_0002-Administration-Workspace-Walk.md) topic details all the available features.

## What You'll Learn

In this topic, you'll learn about:

* [Administration pre-configuration](#Pre-Config).
* [Left-side navigation features](#Left-Side).
* [Accessing the Administration workspace](#Accessing).

##Pre-Configuration {% #Pre-Config %}

Using the Administration features requires that you have access to an administrator account. You also need to organize your goals and any information needed to achieve them. For example, data about users to add them and assign them roles.

##Left-Side Navigation Features {% #Left-Side %}

The left edge of the Administration workspace includes buttons to access more features.

* **Domains**: Click this button to add, edit, or delete an existing domain. Domains organize knowledge and features into unique topic areas.
* **Users**: Click this button to add, edit, or delete a user account. You also can manage roles, user groups, and global user groups.
* **Security**: Click this button to enable authentication systems, authentication policies, virtual hosts. You also can configure your Amelia license and check access logs. 1RPA and 1Store configurations are available as well.
* **UI**: Click this button to configure avatars, avatar voices, UI bundles for a Custom UI, and themes.
* **Orchestrator**: Click this button to configure endpoints, routes, and requests.
* **Content Packs**: Click this button to add, edit, or delete content packs. Content packs are a jar-file containing Amelia-related assets. For example, configuration files, data models, and other artifacts.
