# UI Bundles Configuration

## Introduction

The Amelia UI Bundles feature lets you create custom chat user interfaces. These interfaces display as an overlay on any website. It's possible to customize colors, buttons, menu items, and other details.

To use the UI Bundles workspace, you must understand its features. You'll see the left-side menu and Home tab page on entry into the UI Bundles workspace. This topic gives insight into when and how to use these elements.

##Create a UI Bundle {% #Create %}

To configure the custom UI, you'll need to add a UI bundle for your Amelia instance. Confirm with your Engagement Manager which file is the most current version. The current file is here, dated July 11, 2024:

https://artifactory-us.amelia.com/artifactory/ameliav3-custom-ui/amelia-custom-ui-6.0.24-1720715155675.zip

To create a UI bundle once you have the current downloaded amelia-custom-ui file:

1. In the UI Bundles panel, click the +Add New button. The Create UI Bundle popup will appear.

2. In the popup, enter a code to use in the Code field. Click the Upload File to upload a UI bundle zip file. Click the Create button to save then display the UI Bundle page.

The next step is to configure the custom UI using the UI Bundles page. Each tab on this page has settings with options. Not every tab must be configured. The key tabs are the UI Configuration and Embedding tabs. And each setting within these tabs has self-explanatory descriptions.

> The Custom UI Integration Guide describes all the configuration options available. Request then confirm with your Engagement Manager that you have the latest version of this guide. The guide describes all the configuration settings available. {style="note"}

##Enable and Deploy a UI Bundle {% #Enable %}

To enable and then deploy a custom UI bundle, click the Revisions tab in the UI Bundles page. Then follow these steps:

1. From the list of revisions, find the one to deploy.

2. Click to toggle on the Enabled, Deployed, and Default for Bundle radio buttons.

> Only one UI bundle revision can be configured as Default for Bundle on the Revisions tab. Up to five UI Bundles can be marked as Deployed. And there's no limit to the number of UI Bundles than can be marked as Enabled. {style="note"}

##Deploy a UI Bundle on a Website {% #Deploy %}

Once a UI bundle is enabled, deployed, and marked as the Default for Bundle:

1. Click the Embedding tab in the UI Bundles page.

2. Click the Copy ( ![Copy-Btn-DEB](Copy-Btn-DEB_Debug.png){width="25" style="inline"}) icon to the right of the code snippet near the top of the tab workspace.

3. Open your website footer code. Paste the copied code snippet immediately above the close `<body>` HTML tag.

4. Save the website footer file.

##Edit a UI Bundle {% #Edit %}

To edit a UI bundle:

1. In the UI Bundles panel, find and select the bundle you want to edit. Click it to open it in a tab workspace.

2. With the UI bundle details open, you have access to numerous configuration tabs. The table above lists the tabs and what settings are in each tab.

3. Once your edits are made, save the bundle. Then click the Revisions tab to display the recently edited bundle at the top of the list.

4. Click to toggle on the Enabled, Deployed, and Default for Bundle radio buttons.

Once the updated bundle is saved, test your website to confirm the changes show properly. An Amelia chat icon should appear at the bottom right of the website. Click the chat icon to display the chat interface.

> To limit the chat interface to one domain, in the Embedding tab, update the IFrame URL to add the domain code `?domain=domain-code` where `domain-code` is your domain code. 
> If the IFrame URL is blank, right mouse click over the Default URL and Revision link in the top panel of the tab workspace. Then paste the link into the IFrame URL field in the Embeddings tab.

##Delete a UI Bundle {% #Delete %}

At this time, UI Bundles cannot be deleted. They appear in the Revisions tab with the Enabled, Deployed, and Default for Bundle settings switched off.
