# UI Bundles Introduction

## Introduction

The Amelia UI bundles feature lets you create custom chat user interfaces. These interfaces display as an overlay on any website. It's possible to customize colors, buttons, menu items, and other details.

You can integrate this custom UI into a variety of platforms. For example, different web browsers and iOS/Android applications. It ensures a seamless user experience aligned to your specific needs.

The [UI Bundles Configuration](B01-04_0303-UI-Bundles-Configuration.md) topic has more details about configuring and using bundles.

##How UI Bundles Work {% #How %}

Creating a UI Bundle and custom chat UI requires uploading a zip file with default configuration values. The file contents display in the tabs of the UI Bundle workspace. Once you configure and test a bundle, add a single line of code to your website. It's placed immediately above the close &lt;/body&gt; HTML tag.

## {id="Configur" }Configuring UI Bundles

You use the UI Bundle workspace to make any number of configuration changes. For example, you can configure agent names and avatars if real names and photos are not appropriate. The chat icon that displays on a website also is configurable. Same for colors, icons, and other details.
