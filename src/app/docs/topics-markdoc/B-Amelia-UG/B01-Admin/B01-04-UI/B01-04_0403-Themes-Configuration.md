# Themes Configuration

## Introduction

To use the ThemesÂ workspace, you must understand its features and where to find them. The Themes feature starts with the Light theme and Dark theme. You can adapt one of these themes. Or create your own theme to define a unique look with colors and images that match your brand identity. For example, you can change avatar image or exclude it.

The [Themes Introduction](B01-04_0401-Themes-Intro.md) topic provides basic information about themes.
