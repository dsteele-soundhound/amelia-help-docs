# Themes Introduction

## Introduction

The Amelia application lets you edit and create your own custom themes. The Themes feature starts with the Light theme and Dark theme. You can adapt one of these themes. Or create your own theme to define a unique look with colors and images that match your brand identity. For example, you can change avatar image or exclude it.

Once you've created a theme, you can apply it across all pages. Click the Account Button at the top-left corner on any page. The Account popup will appear with options to change the theme.

The [Light and Dark Mode](A02-00_0009-Light-Dark-Mode.md) topic shows how to change themes. The [Themes Configuration](B01-04_0403-Themes-Configuration.md) topic shows how to edit themes and create new ones.
