# Best Practices: Sources

## Introduction

To get the most from your knowledge sources, follow these best practices.

## What You'll Learn

In this topic, you'll learn about:

* [Best practices for indexing sources](#Index).

* [Best practices for testing and improving sources](#Test).

##Index Sources {% #Index %}

* {% include from="B04-01_0003-BP-Source-Origin.md" element-id="B04-01_0003-BP-Source-Origin_snippet" /%}

* Avoid using tabular data as a knowledge source. This is because Amelia may have difficulty converting tabular data to QA pairs. In a two-column table, it may be unclear whether column A is the question and column B is the answer or vice versa.

##Test and Improve Sources {% #Test %}

* {% include from="B04-01_0003-BP-No-Response.md" element-id="B04-01_0003-BP-No-Response_snippet" /%}

* Understanding how your users interact with Amelia and conversation outcomes is key. To support this, Amelia Answers offers several tools to let you filter and analyze your response data. The Tests tool looks at batches of questions and answers as XLSX files. And the Predict tool tests individual utterances. These tools present live data on response likes and dislikes, question rate, answer accuracy, response time, and more.
