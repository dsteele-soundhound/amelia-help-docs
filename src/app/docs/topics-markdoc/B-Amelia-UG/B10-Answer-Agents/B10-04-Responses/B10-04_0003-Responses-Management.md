1. Find the filters at the top of the Summary table.

2. Apply any of the following filters:

   * **Time**
   * **Domains**
   * **Responder**
   * **Feedback**
   * **With Click**
   * **With Comment**

When you select a filter, it's immediately applied. Refresh the page to refresh the Summary table and clear all applied filters.

##Search for a Response {% #Search %}

The Summary table uses pagination and shows up to 20 rows. This means that a specific response might not show on the front page. Searching is a quick and easy way to find a particular response. The Search field sits at the right of the page and searches on Amelia's response data only.

To search for a response:

1. Position your cursor in the **Search** field.

2. Enter a search term.

Amelia calculates search results from the first character entered. If there are no matches, "No FAQ Queries Matching for Selected Criteria" shows.

> To clear a search, click ![Delete_X-Btn-Amelia_Answers](Delete_X-Btn-Amelia_Answers.png){width="25" style="inline"} alongside your search term.

##View a Response {% #View %}

To open and view a past conversation in more detail:

1. Select any **Summary** table row. The table narrows, and the conversation opens a responder-titled (**DocumentFaq**, **IntentFaq**, or **QaPairsFaq**) panel on the right.

   *The Summary with Response Selected and Responder Panel Highlighted*

2. To close the responder-titled panel, click the ![Delete_X-Btn-Amelia_Answers](Delete_X-Btn-Amelia_Answers.png){width="25" style="inline"}. Your focus returns to the Summary table.
