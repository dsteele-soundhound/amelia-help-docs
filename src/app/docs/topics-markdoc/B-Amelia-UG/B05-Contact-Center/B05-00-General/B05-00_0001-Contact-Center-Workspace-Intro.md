## Included Contact Center Workspace Data and Features {% #Include %}

The Contact Center workspaces include a range of data and features. You can explore escalated conversation and agent performance in detail. Here's a high-level view of data you can browse.

* **Supervisor**: This workspace displays real time agent performance data for active escalated conversations. You can set data to be refreshed automatically. And sort data by domains, escalation queues, and other filters.

* **Escalation Queues**: Use this workspace to create and configure escalation queues. Escalated conversations are assigned to queues. You can configure a default queue for a domain. And assign escalation teams to manage a queue.

* **Escalation Teams**: Use this workspace to assign agents to escalation teams. First, create users in the Administration workspaces. Create escalation teams first, before escalation queues.

* **Response Templates**: This workspace lets you create common responses for agents to use. They work as templates as agents manage escalated conversations. Canned responses help save time for agents. And ensures consistency across all channels.

* **Agents**: Use this workspace to find user accounts and then assign them to escalation teams.

* **Settings**: This workspace lets you toggle on or off the Agent workspace widgets. You can simplify what displays in the right column of the Agent workspace.
