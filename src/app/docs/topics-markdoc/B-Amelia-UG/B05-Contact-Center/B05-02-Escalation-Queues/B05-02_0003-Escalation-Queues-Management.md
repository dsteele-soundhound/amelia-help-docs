# Escalation Queues Management

## Introduction

To use Escalation Queues to organize and assign escalated conversations, you must understand their features and how to configure them. This topic gives insights into when and how to use escalation queues.

See the [Escalation Queues Introduction](B05-02_0002-Escalation-Queues-Intro.md) topic for a high-level introduction to how conversations are queued and agents notified.

### The Escalation Queues Panel

This panel appears between the left-edge links and the Contact Center Home workspace. The panel displays a list of escalation teams.

To toggle open the Escalation Queues panel, click the **Escalation Queues** icon link on the left-edge links.

To close the panel, click the ![B03-04-DEB-Btn-Panel-Close](B03-04-DEB-Btn-Panel-Close.png){width="25" style="inline"} icon at the top right of the **Escalation Teams** panel.

[Escalation Queues Panel Elements]

### The Escalation Queues Workspace

The Escalation Queues tab workspace has these elements:

* A top panel with buttons to save and delete the escalation queue.

* A workspace to define the escalation queue.

The workspace has tabs to configure each individual escalation queue.

| Escalation Notification Timeout (seconds)                                      | Click or type time in seconds. While a default value is provided for this SLA setting, the actual value is to be determined by client circumstances. The escalation service uses this setting to calculate the timeout value, which is 0.7 * Escalation Notification Timeout value. All agents have this amount of time to respond before the request times out and another agent is tried. The default timeout is 10 seconds, which gives an agent in Amelia's user interface 7 seconds (0.7 * 10 = 7 seconds) to respond. While this setting value is fine for agents using Amelia's interface, 7 seconds is far too short for an agent in a third party system receiving requests from an Amelia gateway. When using a gateway, a better value would be 30 seconds or a minute which is roughly 85 seconds (0.7 * 85 = 59.5 seconds). A large Escalation Notification Timeout value affects all agents, even those using Amelia's interface. The escalation service will not send a request to an agent that already has an outstanding request. If the requests don't timeout quickly, the escalation service could run out of agents to notify if they are not responding. |
| Max Consecutive Timeouts                                                       | Click or type maximum number of consecutive timeouts allowed. An algorithm determines the best available agent based on various factors, including timeout count. If an agent has reached the value set with this Max Consecutive Timeouts setting, the agent is placed Offline and dropped out of the algorithm. Agents will receive a notification that they have been set Offline. It is up to the agent to set their status back to Online after acknowledging the notification. When set to 0, agent status will not be set to Offline automatically. If an Amelia gateway is implemented, the gateway is always ready and immediately sets its status back Online when the gateway gets any offline notification. Therefore, it never appears that the gateway goes offline and thus the escalation service will continue to send escalation requests to the gateway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
