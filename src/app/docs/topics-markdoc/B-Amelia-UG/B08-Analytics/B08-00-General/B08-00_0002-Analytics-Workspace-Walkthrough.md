To use the Analytics workspace effectively, you must understand its features and tools and where to find them. The left-side menu lets you access features used to create conversation flows. The Home tab has cards to access many of these features and tools and go directly to work in progress.

* [The Analytics Home tab workspace](#The).
* [The left-edge buttons in the Analytics workspaces](#Left-Ed).

##The Analytics Home Tab Workspace {% #The %}

The default workspace includes a search box to display conversation data using a unique conversation ID. Below the search box is a Journey Analytics chart. You can select a date range to update the chart. The chart shows the conversation and resolution flows as Amelia handles conversations. The flow diagram begins with the total number of conversations on the left. Then it evolves to include conversations Amelia covered and escalated conversations.

Click the ![Journey-Btn-ShowDetails](Journey-Btn-ShowDetails.png){width="25" style="inline"} button at the top left of the Journey Analytics chart to display charts for each step in the journey.

## Left-Edge Buttons in Analytics Workspaces {% #Left-Ed %}

In addition to the Home tab, a set of left-edge buttons provide access to detailed performance data.

### Conversation Analytics

Clicking this button displays a flyout menu with four link options.

* **Conversations**: Clicking the Conversations flyout link displays an All Conversations tab workspace. You can filter the list of conversations by domain and date ranges. You also can set an auto-refresh rate for the list.
* **Dashboard**: Clicking this flyout link displays pie charts and a summary table for common conversation actions. For example, how many conversations Amelia handled. And the number of escalated conversations and abandoned conversations. You can view data by date and domain, as well as domains, escalation queues, agents, flows, and more.
* **Reports**: Clicking the Reports flyout link displays a New Conversation Export tab workspace. Define date range and other parameters. Then click the Create button to export conversations that meet your criteria.
* **Feedback**: Clicking the Feedback flyout link displays a Feedback tab that lists user feedback. You can filter the list by date range, domain, responder, and likes/dislikes. It's also possible to filter by users and agents.

### Journey Analytics

Conversations with Amelia follow a detailed but predictable path, from start to finish. For example, Amelia covers some conversations while escalating others. Agents also handle conversations. These results and more are included in the Journey Analytics tab workspace.

Click the ![Journey-Btn-ShowDetails](Journey-Btn-ShowDetails.png){width="25" style="inline"} button at the top left of the chart to display charts for each journey step.

### NPS Analytics

NPS (Net Promoter Score) captures Amelia's performance based on user feedback and sentiment. Scores summarize user feedback and sentiment plus aspect-based sentiment. NPS is a standardized way to measure user satisfaction over time.

### Amelia Answers Analytics

Clicking the Amelia Answers Analytics buttons displays performance data for this FAQ feature. You can filter data by date range, responders, and domains. A Timeline chart shows likes, dislikes, and neutral ratings of answers. Other charts track Question Rate, Response Time, Answer Accuracy, and Fallback Rate.

### Export Recordings

It's possible to record voice conversations with Amelia. You can download recordings that match a domain and date range that you define.
