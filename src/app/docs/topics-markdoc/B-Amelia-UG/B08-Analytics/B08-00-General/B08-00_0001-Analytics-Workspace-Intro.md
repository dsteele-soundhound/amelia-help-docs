# Analytics Workspace Introduction

## Introduction

The Analytics workspaces let you explore Amelia's behavior. This includes user satisfaction and agent performance. The Conversation Analytics workspace, for example, displays pie charts with conversation data. The chart includes data for domain, escalation queue, agent, conversation flow, conversation folder. With a summary table for each of these filters. The Journey Analytics workspace also shows conversation and resolution rates. Each conversation step from start to end has counts as Amelia handles them.

Our [Analytics Workspace Walkthrough](B08-00_0002-Analytics-Workspace-Walkthrough.md) topic describes these features in more detail.
