If included in an export file, the Escalation Log cell can have many possible values. The cell contains a string with pipe-delimited values. Log entries include escalation type, escalation code, and conversation status.

This example:

`[01/23/2025 09:40:07 ; NORMAL ; Misunderstanding ; ABANDONED] 04/23/2019 09:40:07 NO_AGENTS_AVAILABLE, , Count: 721||04/23/2019 09:55:08 CONVERSATION_CLOSED, , Count: 0`

Uses this format:

`[ Escalation Time ; Escalation Type ; Escalation Reason ; Escalation Status (ending status) ] LogEntryTime EscalationLogStatus, Escalation Notes, Counter`

| Escalation Type       | **NORMAL:** A normal escalation of the conversation from Amelia to an Agent.<br/>**ASSIGNED:** An escalation assigned to a specific agent by another agent or supervisor. The escalation process will direct this escalation at that specific agent and no others, marking it ABANDONED if the targeted agent doesn't pick up.<br/>**TRANSFER:** An escalation transferred from one agent to another. The escalation is placed in the escalation queue and the escalation process will determine, and contact, the next available agent.<br/>**STEAL:** An agent or supervisor with the AUTHORITY_CONVERSATION_STEAL authority stole an escalation from another agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Escalation Log Status | Assigning an escalation to a user is different than transferring a conversation. When assigning an escalation, an agent/supervisor directly chooses which agent should handle the conversation. When transferring a conversation, the agent places the conversation into the escalation queue and the escalation service finds the next available agent. The ASSIGNED_AGENT and MANUAL_PICKUP codes only apply to the assigned scenario, not to the default behavior of the escalation service.<br/> **ASSIGNED_AGENT:** Logged when an escalation is manually assigned to an agent by another agent/supervisor.<br/>**AGENT_PICKUP:** Logged when the agent has successfully picked up either an escalated or non-escalated conversation.<br/>**MANUAL_PICKUP:** Logged when an agent successfully picks up a conversation that has been manually ASSIGNED to them by another agent/supervisor.<br/>**AGENT_PICKUP_TIMEOUT:** Logged if the escalation times out when attempting to contact an agent to handle the escalation. Also logged if an error occurs attempting to contact an agent.<br/>**AGENT_REJECTED:** Logged when an agent manually rejects an escalation request.<br/>**NO_AGENTS_AVAILABLE:** Logged when the escalation service cannot find any agents online and available to send an escalation request to.<br/>**CONVERSATION_CLOSED:** Logged when the escalation service finds an escalated conversation in the escalation queue but cannot find that conversation in the list of active conversations. |

| Counter               | If an event continually occurs successively, a counter is updated instead of writing the same log entry repeatedly. For example, if the escalation process can’t find an available agent for 27 consecutive attempts, instead of storing 27 rows with the status NO_AGENTS_AVAILABLE, the process stores 1 row for NO_AGENTS_AVALABLE and the counter would be incremented for each event, 27 in this case.<br/>The same event might be logged two or more times if one or more events occurs in the middle, for example you could have a log with events such as:<br/>`escalation_log_status: NO_AGENTS_AVAILABLE, counter: 27,escalation_log_status: AGENT_PICKUP_TIMEOUT, counter: 12,escalation_log_status: NO_AGENTS_AVAILABLE, counter: 5,escalation_log_status: AGENT_PICKUP_TIMEOUT, counter: 15,escalation_log_status: AGENT_PICKUP, counter: 0`<br/>The counter only applies to consecutive events and is not a cumulative counter for the event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
