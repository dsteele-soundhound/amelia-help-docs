# Reports Introduction

## Introduction

Using the Reports feature, you can export conversations for offline analysis. It's included in the Conversation Analytics module. Files use CSV (comma separated value) and JSON format. Conversation data includes Max Answer Speed, SLA Violations, total Escalated, and other metrics.

Exports can include up to 2000 conversations in each file. As a date range, domains, and other criteria are selected on the export form, the number of conversations to be exported is displayed in the Create button in the top panel of the form.

The [Reports Management](B08-02_0102-Reports-Walkthrough.md) topic describes how to export conversation data.
