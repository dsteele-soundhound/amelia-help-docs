# Export Recordings Walkthrough

## Introduction

The Export Recordings workspace lets you download one or more audio recordings. This can help analyze and archive relevant voice conversations with Amelia.

Recordings are stored in a separate Amazon Web Services (AWS) website location. You'll need to upload recordings from that location to your Amelia instance. From there, you can download recordings.

## Accessing the Export Recordings Workspace

To access the Export Recordings workspaces:

1. From the top left main navigation menu, click **Analytics**.

2. On the left edge, click the **Export Recordings button** to access features.

   > A Export Recordings panel will appear between the left panel navigation and the Analytics Home tab workspace. {style="note"}
