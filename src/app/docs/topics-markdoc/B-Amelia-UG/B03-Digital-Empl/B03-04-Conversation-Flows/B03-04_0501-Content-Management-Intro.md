# Content Management Introduction

## Introduction

In the course of a conversation, Amelia is able to present files and request files. For example, a person might book a hotel room and see a photo with prices. Or another person might fill out a PDF and then submit an application. The ability to manage files is useful functionality.

Amelia's Content Management feature stores requested files and files presented to people. A dozen different file types can be stored. For example, audio, binary, Word, Excel, HTML, and image files are all acceptable.

In a conversation flow, blocks present or request files. The Present block presents files to people during a conversation. The Request block requests files from people during a conversation. Script blocks also use the Content Management Service to manage files.
