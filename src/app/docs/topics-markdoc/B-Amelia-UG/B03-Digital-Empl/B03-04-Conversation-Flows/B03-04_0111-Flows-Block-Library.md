# Block Library

## Introduction

This Digital Employees builder uses natural conversation to create repeatable and successful processes. This tool requires minimal technical knowledge to use. This is because the tool relies on blocks to build out the conversation flows and apply actions. These blocks are all readily available from the blocks popup and are easy to position as needed. Once positioned, and configured, you'll add connecters and test.

On entry into the Digital Employees builder, you're given a blank canvas and the blocks popup. From here you can start by adding a title to your conversation flow. Then you can set your conversations intent, or you can build and edit your flows settings. The choice is yours.

This topic introduces you to each of the blocks that you'll see on the blocks popup. Follow the links to the full topics to learn more about each of these blocks and their properties.
