# Service Handles Introduction (original version - not used)

## Introduction

Conversations with Amelia can include third-party data. This data is either captured or stored from the conversation or by retrieving data. Conversations also can capture and retrieve user intent. You can capture or retrieve data needed to resolve user intent.

Amelia includes many services to work with data. Each service includes a unique handle and operations. The service handle is a prefix appended to the name of a specific method or operation. Script blocks and tasks can import a service then use its handle and operation to work with data.

Let's say you want to capture the user language locale in a conversation. A Script block could import the Conversation service and use the `conversationService` handle. Then call the `currentUserLanguage()` operation to capture the user locale:
```
import net.ipsoft.amelia.bpn.script.service.conversation.*; locale = conversationService.currentUserLanguage() execution.setVariable("locale",locale)
```

Available services also work with escalations, metrics, logging, content, and other data.
