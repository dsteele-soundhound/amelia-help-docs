# Tabular Data Introduction

## Introduction

You can add data in CSV table format for Amelia to use. For example, resolution codes for agents to use when closing escalated conversations. Or zip codes people select during a conversation with  Amelia. This data exists in Amelia's database. However, it is not available to natural language processing and other features.

The [Tabular Data Management](B03-04_0603-Tabular-Data-Management.md) topic describes how to use tabular data with conversation flows.
