### Conversation Flows Panel

The Conversation Flows panel appears between the left edge navigation links and the builder canvas. You'll see a tree structure of folders and conversation flows. Using this panel, you can create, clone, or delete folders and flows.

### Digital Employees Builder Canvas

A new builder canvas opens as a new tab with the blocks popup in the center. The popup displays the different blocks used to create conversation flows. To start a conversation flow, you'll click the User Says button. Here you'll enter a user utterance that describes your conversation goal or intent. After processing this user utterance, this becomes the Intent block for your conversation flow. Alternatively, you can start a conversation by entering a prompt in the Design Assistant. Leveraging Amelia Builds Amelia feature, the Design Assistant makes it easier to create and change your conversation flows.

The top and right edge of the canvas displays tools to help configure your conversation flows. For example, the Export button exports a conversation flow. And the Error Messages button on the right edge shows any error messages.

Many actions are possible by adding blocks to the builder canvas. Some blocks have yellow and blue tabs. Clicking the block's blue Amelia Says tab and/or yellow user says tab creates and configures a flow. With other blocks, you can create a placeholder connection to a third-party resource, or present a file to your user.

*An Example Conversation Flow*

Once you've built your conversation flow, you'll need to save and preview it. The preview feature lets you play through the conversation and debug any issues. After ensuring your conversation flow is working correctly, you can deploy it. Then, you'll publish your conversation flow and set up the website image. This sets where on your site you want the Amelia overlay and determines its styling. At this point, you can preview your solution again to ensure that the branding and styling align.
