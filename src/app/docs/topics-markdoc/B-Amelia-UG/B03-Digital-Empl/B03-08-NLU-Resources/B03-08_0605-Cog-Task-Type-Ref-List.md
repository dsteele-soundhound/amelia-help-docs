# Task Type Reference List

Some features, like Amelia Answers, need cognitive provider and task setup. Knowing which task types work best on their own or combined and when a specific task type comes into play might seem complex. This topic introduces you to each task type and explains which complement each other and which work best alone.

| Question Answering     | This task type is needed to get Amelia Answers up and running. Question Answering works best when used together with Document Parsing. Question Answering involves finding and picking answers from a given context, based on the question. The task type references the LLM (large language model) only when responding, not when loading the document. {% include from="B03-08_0605-Question-Answering-LangChain.md" element-id="B03-08_0605-Question-Answering-LangChain_snippet" /%} |
| FAQ Correction         | Autocorrects Amelia Answers responses based on user feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Intent Classification  | The provider or prompt to use for LLM-powered intent classification. Detects an intent from a user utterance. To use this feature, you must train an LLM classifier in Models (Digital Employees > NLU Comprehension).                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Entity Extraction      | The provider or prompt to use for LLM-powered entity tagging. Extracts all possible entities from a sentence. Only tags entities marked with 'Use LLM' in the entity's advanced settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Elaborating Question   | Generates clarifying questions for a user when their input is unclear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Document Parsing       | Parses the given document. Typically used for extracting table, and title for the document. Document Parsing controls the usage of LLM for segment titling and non-LangChain PDF table extraction during document ingestion. When paired, Document Parsing enhances the performance of the Question Answering task type. Embeddings can significantly speed up document parsing. Therefore, we recommend using the Embeddings and Document Parsing task types together.                                                      |
| Sentence Parsing       | Used for analyzing sentences and extracting information about the roles of different words and the implications of verbs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Embeddings             | Used to extract embeddings, which are then used in finding semantic similarity and for retrieval-based augmentation. Also, the task type determines which embeddings to use when converting documents for the vector store. Embeddings can significantly speed up document parsing. Therefore, we recommend using the Embeddings and Document Parsing task types together. When uploading a set of documents, don't change the task type during upload as it may result in errors.                                           |
| Agent Recommendation   | Used for generating suggestions, and the conversation summary for the agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| LangChain              | Used for interaction with the LangChain service. {% include from="B03-08_0605-Question-Answering-LangChain.md" element-id="B03-08_0605-Question-Answering-LangChain_snippet" /%}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
