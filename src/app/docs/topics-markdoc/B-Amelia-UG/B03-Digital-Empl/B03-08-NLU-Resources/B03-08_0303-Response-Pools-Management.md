# Response Pools Management

## Introduction

To use the Response PoolsÂ workspace, you must understand its features and where to find them. Response pools are a collection of possible responses. Amelia uses pools to randomly select responses for specific purposes. To greet users, a greeting response pool might have many possible utterances. Amelia would select a greeting for the start of each interaction.

See our [Response Pools Introduction](B03-08-NLU-Resources_B03-08_0301-Response-Pools-Intro.md) topic for details about response pools.

### The Response Pools Panel

This panel appears between the left-edge links and the Digital Employees Home workspace. The panel displays a list of response pool groups, pools, and responses.

To toggle open the Response Pools panel, click the NLU Resources icon link on the left-edge links. Then click the Response Pools link in a flyout menu that appears. To close the panel, click the ![B03-04-DEB-Btn-Panel-Close](B03-04-DEB-Btn-Panel-Close.png){width="25" style="inline"} icon at the top right of the Response Pools panel.

The Response Pools panel has two links:

* A Response Pools link that displays response pools used to organize responses. It includes the ability to add, edit, delete, import, and export pools and their responses. You also can search for pools and display pools by response group.

* A Response Groups link that displays groups. Groups organize response pools and their responses. It includes the ability to add one or more groups.

Click the Response Pool or Response Group link to display or hide options and a list of artifacts.
