### How Amelia Builds Amelia Works

Suppose your user wants to pay bills from their bank account. Amelia Builds Amelia uses models, use cases, prompts, and other data to:

* Create utterances that trigger an intent to pay bills from a bank account.
* Create data entities, such as, username, bank account, and amount to pay.
* Create placeholders connecting with bank systems to confirm user accounts and bills.

The result is a full conversation flow. If your user enters a bad password, for example, the conversation includes a path to alert them and let them retry.

### Creating Digital Employees

#### Using a Prompt

Enter prompts in the available text box to create your digital employee. Prompts are a great way to tell Amelia what you want to do and how you want to do it. Type or speak a sentence that describes the purpose of your digital employee. See the [Best Practices: Prompt Engineering](B03-03_0004-BP-Prompt-Engineering.md) topic for ideas on crafting successful prompts.

#### Uploading Documents and Transcripts

#### Using a Catalog

You can create a digital employee using Amelia's catalog of pre-built use cases organized by type. You'll find these in the center of the Amelia Builds Amelia workspace.

### Chatting with Amelia

The Amelia Builds Amelia workspace also includes a chat interface. Using the chat interface, type the word "Build" to start the creation process. Amelia then asks you to describe the purpose of your digital employee. Type a prompt that describes the purpose of the employee. Amelia then interacts with you to create and deploy your employee.

### Customizing Results

To refine your conversation flow, you can also import transcripts from other sources, for example, Google Dialogflow and Amazon Lex.
