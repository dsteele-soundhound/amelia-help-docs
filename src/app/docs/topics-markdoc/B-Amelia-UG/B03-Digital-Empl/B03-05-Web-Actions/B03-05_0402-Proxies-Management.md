# Proxies Management

## Introduction

To use the ProxiesÂ workspace, you must understand its features and where to find them. Web Actions use a web interface to configure connections to third-party resources. These resources require secure connections. Proxy servers provide a secure way to access third-party data in a conversation flow. Digital Employees builderBackend blocks and BPN Consume Web Service tasks can use proxy server connections to access data. See the [Proxies Introduction](B03-05_0401-Proxies-Intro.md) topic for details.
