# Proxies Introduction

## Introduction

Amelia can work with proxy servers. A proxy server sits between Amelia and a third-party online resource. It manages traffic between Amelia and the resource. Proxy servers provide enhanced security and access to location-specific data.

You can configure proxy server access for use in Amelia conversation flows. Then use the proxy server in the Digital Employees builderBackend block or the BPN Consume Web Service task.

You create proxy server connections independently in  Amelia. Then connect them to one or more web actions. Calling a web action in a conversation flow uses any proxy server assigned to the action.
