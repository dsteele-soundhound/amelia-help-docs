# Certificates Management

## Introduction

To use the Certificates workspace, you must understand its features and where to find them. Web Actions use a web interface to configure connections to third-party resources. These resources require secure connections. Certificates provide a secure way to use third-party data in a conversation flow. Digital Employees builderBackend blocks and BPN Consume Web Service tasks use certificates to pass data. See the [Certificates Introduction](B03-05_0301-Certificates-Intro.md) topic for details.
