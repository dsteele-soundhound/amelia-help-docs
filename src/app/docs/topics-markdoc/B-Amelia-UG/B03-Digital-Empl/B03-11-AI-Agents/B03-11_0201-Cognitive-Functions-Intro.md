The [Cognitive Functions Introduction](B03-11_0201-Cognitive-Functions-Intro.md) topic describes how to create functions used by Cognitive Agents. The [AI Agents Introduction](B03-11_0001-AI-Agents-Intro.md) topic describes Agentic AI and how it compares to other AI methods.

##What are Cognitive Functions? {% #Definition %}

Cognitive Functions include all the elements needed to perform one or more related tasks. They're used by the Cognitive Agents feature as needed. Functions must be strictly relevant to the agent task.

There are three tools used to create Cognitive Functions. What works best depends on your goals and needs.

* **Web Actions** - Use a web interface to create a function to connect to third-party resources. Connections are reusable. Cognitive Agents use these actions directly or in a Conversation AI flow. See the [Web Actions Introduction](B03-05_0101-Web-Actions-Intro.md) topic for more details.

* **Conversation Flows** - The Digital Employees builder, or DEB, uses natural conversation to help you build repeatable process flows. These flows typically complete one or more tasks, such as handling personal banking. See the [Conversation Flows Introduction](B03-04_0100-Conversation-Flows-Intro.md) topic for more details.

* **Integrations** - Amelia includes an integration framework and tools to create integration flows. The framework can customize logic and overrides needed to connect with services. The framework uses the Camel expression language. See the [Integrations Introduction](B03-06_0201-Integrations-Intro.md) topic for more details.
