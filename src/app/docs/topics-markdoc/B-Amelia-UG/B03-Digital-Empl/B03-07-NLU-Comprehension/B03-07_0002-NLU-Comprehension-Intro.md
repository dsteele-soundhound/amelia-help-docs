# NLU Comprehension Introduction

## Introduction

Training an artificial intelligence (AI) like Amelia is like training a person. People and AIs are not born knowing how to speak a language or perform tasks. Learning requires study of relevant information with lots of practice and testing.

The heart of training an AI is Natural Language Understanding, also called NLU. It's what helps a computer understand human speech by using everyday language. It's the part of Amelia that figures out the meaning of words and sentences. It includes understanding feelings based on words choices and sentence structures.

Because computers are not humans, NLU also has limitations. Amelia might not understand a word in a particular situation. People also might use slang phrases. In those cases, Amelia escalates a conversation to a human to help. Amelia then helps agents by summarizing the conversation with possible answers or actions.

Training involves teaching Amelia with intents, entities, ontologies, and other tools. Plus, preparing training data for machine learning models. And, in some cases, using large language models instead of models.

This diagram shows the high-level conversation flow Amelia uses to process conversations.
