# Entities Management

## Introduction

{% include from="B03-07_0301-Entities-Intro.md" element-id="B03-07_0301-Entities-Intro_snippet" /%}

Entities can be identified and extracted by training machine learning models. Or using LLMs. See our [Models Introduction](B03-07-NLU-Comprehension_B03-07_0701-Models-Intro.md) topic or the LLM topic for details.

To use entities to capture user data, you must understand their features and how to configure them. This topic gives insights into when and how to use entities. See the [Entities Introduction](B03-07-NLU-Comprehension_B03-07_0301-Entities-Intro.md) topic for a high-level introduction to entities.

##Add or Create an Entity {% #Adding %}

To use entities to capture user data, you'll need to add or create entities in your Amelia instance.

> Role entities have a parent entity. This lets the parent and role entities collect related information. To create a role entity, on the Basic tab, you'll enter the Name, Code, Description, Datum Type and Status. On the Properties tab, you'll scroll to and select the Role Type. Then, you'll click the + Add button to create child entities.

> Extracting entities with an LLM uses the Entities panel, not the Models panel. While it's possible to create an entity model, it's not needed when using an LLM. To extract entities with an LLM, you'll set the Description (Basic tab) and Use LLM (Properties tab) fields. See the element tables below for more information.

To create an entity:

1. In the **Entities** panel, click the **+ Add New** button. A New Entity page opens after the Home page. The New Entity page has two tabs. One tab for Basic settings and the second for Properties settings.

2. Give your entity **a Name**.

3. Complete remaining Basic and Properties settings as needed.

   Open these dropdowns to learn about the elements you'll see when adding entities.

   These tables show elements for the Custom Datum default datum type. For other combinations, see the [Edit an Entity](#Editing) section below.

Extract Articles (true/false) extracts and normalizes articles like "a" or "an". Lenient Decimal Delimiters (true/false) sets the leniency or strictness with what's acceptable as a decimal delimiter. Use Default Unit (true/false) sets what default unit applies, and whether to extract the datum when a unit isn't provided. And, Default Unit sets the unit used for the entity when none was provided by the user.</li> <li><strong>Airport / Capital / Country / Device Type / Duration Range / Email / Identifier / IP Address / Location / Notable Person / Notable Place / Occupation / Ordinal / Ordinal Range / Organization / Phone Number / Postal Code / Product / Response / Stock Ticker Name / Street Address / Text / US County / US State:</strong> Shows no entity settings for extraction and/or normalization.</li> <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> Shows entity settings used to configure extraction and/or normalization. Answer Polarity (true/false) sets whether to use or not use answer polarity to extract boolean entities.</li> <li><strong>City:</strong> Shows entity settings used to configure extraction and/or normalization. Cities That Need to Be Ignored lists cities that Amelia shouldn't extract.</li> <li><strong>Composite Datum:</strong> Shows composite datum settings. Composite Entity Fields lets you define fields (sub-entity) extracted as part of this composite entity. Field Groups defines relations or constraints for groups of composite entity fields. For more information, see the [Composite Datum Entities](#) section below.</li> <li><strong>Custom Datum:</strong> Shows entity settings and advanced options used to configure extraction and/or normalization. Custom Entity Type sets the general entity normalization or extraction approach. Lookup Strategy sets the strategy used to match entries in a table to the user utterance. Lookup Table Entries defines mappings from inputs to normalized outputs. Extract/Normalize sets whether to extract, normalize or both. Fallback Strategy provides the default normalized value for when an entities extracted but isn't normalized. Preprocessors sets the pre-processor for non-grammar sources. And, Lammatize Nouns (yes/no) lets you normalize nouns to their base form, for example, "apples" to "apple".</li> <li><strong>Date / Date Range / Date and Time / Date and Time Range / Time / Time Range / Year Month:</strong> Shows entity settings used to configure extraction and/or normalization. Filter Type sets the types of dates and times to filter out. Blacklist Regex filters particular date patterns based on the regular expression set. Date Type sets Amelia's assumptions where a user provides an ambiguous date. Select Timezone sets the timezone used for entity extraction. Extract Implicit Date from Date Range sets the starting date for the date range. And, Default to Range sets the time range, applicable to the date and time or date and time range types only.

##Search for Entities {% #Search %}

As you develop your Amelia instance, you'll add to your entities. The Entities panel shows your entities using pagination. This means that a particular entity might not show on the front page. Searching is a quick and easy way to find an entity.

> The search feature also applies to datum types. Search the term "address," for example, to display all entities that use the Address datum type.

To search for an entity:

1. In the Entities panel, position your cursor in the Search Here field.

2. Enter a search term. Your search term can include letters, numbers, and special characters.

Amelia calculates search results from the first character entered. If there are no matches, "No Entities Found" shows.

##Edit an Entity {% #Editing %}

Refining your entities is an important part of training Amelia.

To edit an entity:

1. In the Entities panel, find and select the entity you want to edit.

2. With your entity open in edit mode, you have access to a range of elements. The entity editor includes a header area and two tabs. One tab shows Basic settings and a second Property settings.

   Every entity is either normalized or non-normalized. An entity that's normalized uses standard built-in definitions. An entity that's non-normalized hasn't undergone cleansing and de-duplication and isn't consistently organized. Non-normalized entities don't use the built-in entity extractor and normalizer for entity data. Instead, you extract and normalize these entities with a mix of regular expressions, tabular data, and grammars. See our [Datum Types Library](B03-07_0101-Datum-Types-Library.md) topic for information about the datum types used by entities.

   The following sections look at editing a variety of normalized and non-normalized entities. Open these dropdowns to learn more about what you'll see in the entity editor.

For example, "tomorrow" or "March 17th". * Ignore Missing Either Date or Time: Ignore temporal expressions missing either the date or the time. * Ignore Times Missing Dates: Ignore any times missing explicit dates. For example, "12 PM". * No Filtering: Doesn't filter dates or times based on types.                                                                           |

     | Date Type                            | Default (Assume Convention) | Specify any assumptions made when the user provides ambiguous dates. These dates could refer to either past or future dates. For example, in the year 2018, saying "July 3rd" could refer to 7/3/2018, 7/3/2019, or other dates. * Default: Assume convention. * Expiration Date: Assume expiration date mm/yy. * Future Date: Only show dates in the future. * Past Date: Only show dates in the past. * Resolve to Future Date: Resolves ambiguous time to future date. * Resolve to Past Date: Resolves ambiguous time to past date. |

3. Click Save.

##Delete an Entity {% #Deleting %}

You can delete a single entity using the entity editor, or you can delete one or more entities using the Entities panel.

### Delete an Entity Using the Entities Editor

To delete an single entity:

1. In the Entity panel, find and select the entity to delete.

2. In the entity editor, in the header area, click the Delete button.

3. At the Delete Confirmation modal, click Delete. Alternatively, click Cancel to cancel the operation.

### Delete Entities from the Entities Panel

To delete one or many entities, use the Entities panel:

1. In the Entities panel, find one or many entities to delete.

2. Click the checkboxes to the right of your chosen entities.

   > The + Add New and Import buttons at the top of the panel change to Delete and Export buttons.
3. Click the Delete button.

##Export an Entity {% #Exportin %}

After testing your entities, you're ready to deploy. Deploying means promoting your entities from a lower instance to production. That's where exporting and importing comes into play. Amelia gives you the option to export one entity or many entities.

When you export an entity, you download a JSON file to your chosen Downloads location. Once downloaded, you can import this file to another domain.

To export one or more entities:

1. In the Entities panel, find one or many entities to export.

2. Click the checkboxes to the right of your chosen entities.

   > The + Add New and Import buttons at the top of the Entities panel change to Delete and Export buttons.
3. Click the Export button. The package downloads immediately, named similarly to your domain. You'll find the downloaded JSON file in your default downloads location.

##Import an Entity {% #Importin %}

After exporting your entity, you'll import it to the new domain. The Entities panel lets you import previously downloaded entity JSON files or grammar XML files.

### Import Entities From an Entities File

When you import entities, you upload the previously exported JSON file.

1. In the Entities panel, click the Import button. The Upload Entities File modal shows.

2. From the Source options, click From File.

3. From the Conflicts Resolution dropdown, make a selection:

   1. Merge with Existing: This option keeps the existing entities, and adds all new entities.

   2. Overwrite Existing: This option overwrites existing entities, and adds all new entities.

   3. Add to Existing: This option adds new entities only.

4. Drag and drop your JSON file to the upload area.

   > To remove the connected file, click the ![Delete-Btn-DEB](Delete-Btn-DEB.png){width="25" style="inline"} button at the right of the modal. Alternatively, browse for and select another file to replace your original selection.
5. Click the Upload button. Alternatively, click cancel to cancel the operation.

Your imported entity shows in the Entities panel.

### Import Entities from a Grammars File

When you import entities from grammars, you upload the previously exported XML file. <madcap:conditionaltext madcap:conditions="Default.ContentInternal">
See our Grammars Management topic to learn more. 

1. In the Entities panel, click the Import button. The Upload Entities File modal shows.

2. From the Source options, click From Grammar.

3. Click the Upload button. Alternatively, click Cancel to cancel the operation.

A new entity shows in the Entities panel named according to your imported grammar.

## Best Practices

Keep the following best practices in mind as you work with entities:

* Entity names should be unique, descriptive and uniform in structure. This is especially true if you're creating many entities.

* Avoid utterance examples that include one word. Instead, use phrases with variations of the entity. This helps Amelia identify patterns and where the entity resides in the pattern.
