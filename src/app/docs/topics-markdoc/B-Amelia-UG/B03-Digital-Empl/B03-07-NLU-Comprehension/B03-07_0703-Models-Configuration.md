# Models Configuration

## Introduction

To use models to train Amelia, you must first understand models and how to configure them. This topic gives insights into when and how to use the Models panel and associated elements.

Models use machine learning algorithms to process utterances. These utterances have words and phrases that describe a specific user intent. When processing live conversations, the trained model helps identify user intent or goal. Models can also capture entities in raw unstructured sentences.

Amelia uses two types of models to identify user intent. Models created with machine learning algorithms and models created with LLMs. You train both types of models. For learning algorithm models, you use conversation utterances. LLM models use prompts and training the LLM itself. Both types of models create intent models and entity models. However, entity models are unnecessary when using an LLM.

See the [Models Introduction](B03-07-NLU-Comprehension_B03-07_0701-Models-Intro.md) topic for a high-level introduction to models.

2. Choose the Model Type to Train.

3. Give your model a Name.

4. Click Create.

After clicking Create, Amelia updates. Your model shows in the Models panel, and the model's configuration workspace shows the Train, Evaluation Statistics, and Log tabs. To learn more about model configuration, see [Edit a Model](#Edit) and [Train a Model](#Train), both below in this article.

##Add or Create a New Episodic Model {% #AddEpisodic %}

Episodic models are agent recommendation models. Agents who handle escalations use episodic models as a whisper agent. The episodic model processes the escalation conversation with an agent. The model then outputs recommended responses to the agent based on the conversation topics. This is different from other models. Amelia uses those models to respond to non-escalated conversations.

Adding a new episodic model offers deep reinforcement learning. The model splits utterances and interactions into episodes. Amelia calculates the total reward at the end of each episode. Episodic memory can help AI improve decision-making, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities. Episodic models learn from past experiences. Episodic memory can store accurate memories from a single exposure to the environment. Partial cues can retrieve memories. These models also store and recall large amounts of experience.

To add a new episodic model:

1. At the top of the Models panel, click the Ellipsis ( ![B03-07_0703-Models-Btn-3Dots](B03-07_0703-Models-Btn-3Dots.png){width="25" style="inline"}) button.

2. Click Add New Episodic Model. A New Episodic Model page opens after the Home page.

##Search for Models {% #Search %}

As you develop your Amelia instance, you'll add models. The Models panel shows your models using pagination. This means that a particular model might not show on the front page. Searching is a quick and easy way to find an model.

To search for a model:

1. In the Models panel, position your cursor in the Search Here field.

2. Enter a search term. Your search term can include letters, numbers, and special characters.

Amelia calculates search results from the first character entered. If there are no matches, "No Models Found" shows.

##Edit a Model {% #Edit %}

Refining your models is an important part of training Amelia.

1. In the Models panel, find and select the model you want to edit.

   With your model open in edit mode, you have access to a range of elements. The model editor includes a header area and a series of tabs showing the following:
   * **Train Tab**: Shows configuration settings based on the type of model being trained.
   * **Evaluation Statistics Tab**: Shows training data to gauge model performance.
   * **Log Tab**: Shows a list of actions from training a model.

   Open these dropdowns to learn more about available header and tab elements.
   <chapter title="Edit Model Header Area" collapsible="true" level="5">

   The header area provides information about a model. Includes the ability to perform actions on the model. For example, to deploy or undeploy a model and view revisions to the model.

See [Add a Model](#AddGeneral) to learn more about the New Model Type to Train element. * Confidence Weighted Classifier: Available with the Domain Classifier, Intent Classifier, Role Entity Classifier, Spanless Entity Classifier, and Intent Detector model types. This algorithm takes parameter confidence information into account. A probability formula assigns different margins for different instances. * CRF Tagger: Available with the Entity Tagger model type. The Conditional Random Field (CRF) tagger handles long distance dependencies well. It considers neighboring samples. It can work with entities that are more than two tokens long. Extracted token values should be contiguous and their order should be important. Large data sets work best with this tagger. The CRF tagger learns the probability of transitions between labels in a sequence. Then it maximizes the probability across the whole sequence of tokens. In practice, the CRF Tagger does better for longer sequences of labels and entities with more words. For example, when the entity label depends more on later tokens in the entity instead of the first few tokens. CRF also uses a transition matrix to estimate transition weights. This requires more training data than Passive Aggressive or Linear SVM Taggers. This tagger often needs gazetteers to perform well in tagging tasks. * DNN Classifier: This bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm works well with larger data sets. * DNN Tagger: This algorithm is a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) tagger. It works well with larger data sets. With enough training data, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) Tagger performs better than both linear models. And it does this without the need for gazetteer features. * Ensemble Classifier: Available with the Domain Classifier, Intent Classifier, Role Entity Classifier, Spanless Entity Classifier, and Intent Detector model types. This algorithm combines several model classifiers. The new classifier performs better than the models used to create it. * Linear SVM: Available with the Domain Classifier, Intent Classifier, Role Entity Classifier, Spanless Entity Classifier, and Intent Detector model types. Similar to the Passive Aggressive classifier, this algorithm maximizes the distances between classes. Useful when two intents have data sets with similar example utterances. For example, making a hotel reservation versus canceling a hotel reservation. * Linear SVM Tagger: Available with the Entity Tagger model type. This tagger works well when entities are a length of 1-2 tokens. Can work well when there is less data available. The next token in a sequence, the immediate previous prediction, and locally extracted features all help generate predictions. This works well where there are no dependencies between entities. For example, single-word entities or short phrasal entities like named entities. The first few tokens mostly generate predictions. * LLM Classifier: Available with the Intent Classifier model type. This algorithm uses an LLM to identify intents. * Logistic Regression: Available with the Domain Classifier, Intent Classifier, Role Entity Classifier, Spanless Entity Classifier, and Intent Detector model types. This algorithm produces scores as probabilities to create thresholds. These thresholds help control the precision of the classifier. * Meta Classifier: This algorithm is the default for Domain Classifier, Intent Classifier, Intent Detector, Role Entity Classifier, and Spanless Entity Classifier models. This algorithm makes a final prediction among all possible classifier predictions. It uses predictions as features, an individual measurable property, or characteristic. * Meta Tagger: Available with the Entity Tagger model type. This algorithm makes a final prediction among all possible classifier predictions. It uses predictions as features, an individual measurable property or characteristic. * Neural Network: Available with the Domain Classifier, Entity Tagger, Intent Classifier, Spanless Entity Classifier, and Intent Detector model types. * Passive Aggressive Classifier: Available with the Domain, Intent Classifier, Role Entity Classifier, Spanless Entity Classifier, and Intent Detector model types. This algorithm updates its weighting measurements while processing new data. It also tracks incorrect classifications and uses that information to optimize results. This classifier allows for multi-class single label classification. * Passive Aggressive Tagger: Available with the Entity Tagger model type. Similar to Passive Aggressive for intents but this is a Passive Aggressive tagger. The Passive Aggressive tagger tags sentences sequentially. Predictions are based on the next token in the sequence and on the immediate previous predictions, as well as locally extracted features. This works well for single-word entities, or short phrasal entities like named entities, where there are no real dependencies between entities, and the prediction of the entity can be mostly based on its first few tokens. This tagger typically needs gazetteers to perform well in tagging tasks. * Semantic Mapping Classifier: This is the default algorithm for the Intent Filter model type. It looks at the connections and meanings of words and concepts. * Soft Confidence Weighted Classifier: Available with the Domain Classifier, Intent Classifier, Role Entity Classifier, Spanless Entity Classifier, and Intent Detector model types. This algorithm includes a parameter to temper its updating strategy. This helps to optimize classifications. * Trie Classifier: Stores results as strings like a graph. Can help resolve certain intent-related keyword matching issues. * Trie-based Matcher: Available with the Domain Classifier, Intent Classifier, Spanless Entity Classifier, and Intent Detector model types. |

Training time will take longer. Generally, this setting is ideal if a dataset is noisy or highly variable.

Higher values give a more accurate approximation of the objective. However, they tend to overfit to the training data in practice.

Which encoder is the best choice is often specific to a use case and dataset. Trialing different encoders is sometimes best to ensure the best results. * ELMO_ENCODER: An older embeddings model. It often is computationally less expensive than the PT encoder. * PT_ENCODER:A BERT-based embeddings encoder that generally performs well across most use cases. It is rarely used. * SETFIT_ENCODER: An encoder often used for models that need to perform well given little training data. It may outperform other encoders in such cases.

Different choices affect training time, inference speed, model size, and performance. * biLTSM: A form of recurrent neural network known as a bidirectional long short-term memory network. This is the go-to model for most cases. * CNN: A recurrent neural network known as a bidirectional long short-term memory network. This is the most efficient go-to model for most cases. * biGRU:An alternative to biLSTM models. It is often smaller and faster to train, but worse at capturing complexity in the training data. * BERT: A Transformer-based approach. It incorporates pre-trained knowledge. Generally, it is the best performance available of these options. However, it results in greater model size, longer training times, and longer inference time.

L1 regularization is useful for feature selection when number of features is high. L2 regularization discourages and avoids overfitting. DUAL types are better when the number of features is more than the number of samples.

   <chapter title="Evaluation Statistics Tab" collapsible="true" level="5">
   
   The Evaluation Statistics tab lists trained data sets for the selected model. The training data is split into equal sized data sets. One data set is used for testing and validation with the remaining data sets used for training. The process is repeated until every data set has been used for validation and training.
   
   When training a model, the training data shows divided into equal sets, such as 3, 5, or 10 sets. Use one data set for validation testing and the rest for training. Then repeat this process with the other parts. Use another part for validation while using the remaining parts for training. Amelia repeats the process until every part validates and trains. On the Evaluation Statistics tab, select a data set to see its performance statistics. These statistics open in a new page tab, showing details of validation and training performance.
   
   If you use a custom test dataset for training, metrics for the dataset will appear in the dataset_name_validation line, where dataset_name is the name of your custom test dataset.
   
   In this situation, the validation line is never part of the cross-validation output. If you do not use a custom test dataset, then the _validation line only gives you the results of the full model, tested on all its training data, with no folds or splits.

   *The Evaluation Statistics Tab*
   
   Clicking an entry opens the performance statistics for the selected data set. Inside these performance statistics, you'll see three types of statistics. These show as separate tabs:
   
   * **Statistics Tab**: Shows scores for a variety of standard machine learning metrics.
   
   * **Confusion Matrix Tab**: Shows the number of times each label row had the incorrect label.
   
   * **Misclassification Tab**: Shows utterances incorrectly labeled or not labeled at all.
   
   After reviewing statistics, correct any training data imbalances. There are several options to consider.
   
   * Strengthen a label by adding more utterances containing key phrases.
   
   * Weaken a label by removing utterances containing key phrases.
   
   * Reclassify some utterances to different labels.
   
   Don't add more data for the sake of data. The data set should have variety in sentence structure and word choice. Repeating the same sentence structures causes over-fitting. For example, utterances that begin with, "I want to book a room", "I want to get a room", "I want to reserve a room". When a person says to Amelia, "I want to" whatever, the over-fitted label will match incorrectly.
   
   After making training data changes, retrain the model. Run it against the same validation set to see how results changed. Repeat this process until the statistics for the model have improved in a balanced way. For example, confirm the validation statistics for one intent don't drop while statistics for another improves.

   ### Misclassifications Tab
   
   The Misclassifications tab shows the utterances incorrectly labeled or not labeled at all.
   
   When model training begins, Amelia knows nothing. The first predictions of which label an utterance belongs to are guesses. You'll likely see some misses in any trained model.

2. In the model editor, edit the model as needed.

3. Click the Train button to train your model. The model is saved automatically once training is completed.

## Train a Model {% #Train %}

Training a model is an iterative process. A model is created, defined, trained, and tested. The Evaluation Statistics and Log tabs of the model workspace display test results. Testing can include deploying a model and engaging Amelia in conversation. Test results often leads to editing and training the model again. Training is complete when the model performs as expected.

To train your model:

1. In the Models panel, find and select the model you want to deploy.

2. In the model editor's header area, click the Train button.

##Manage Model Revisions {% #Manage %}
