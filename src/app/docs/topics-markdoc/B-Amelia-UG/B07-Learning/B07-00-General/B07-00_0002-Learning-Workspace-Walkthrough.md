# Learning Workspace Walkthrough

## Introduction

To use the Learning workspace effectively, you must understand its features and tools and where to find them. The left-side buttons lets you access features used to create conversation flows. The Home tab has cards to access these features and tools and go directly to work in progress.

The elements of this workspace are described below in detail.

## What You'll Learn

In this topic you'll learn about:

* [The Learning Home tab workspace](#The).
* [The left-edge buttons in the Learning workspace](#The2).

## The Learning Home Tab Workspace {% #The %}

The Learning Home page shows as a page tab. Home serves as the starting point for learning about conversation flow performance. You'll navigate the Home page by moving through the individual cards presented to you. Click an artifact name in a card to go directly to that workspace.

The buttons on the left-edge of this workspace provide full access to Learning features.

##The Left-Edge Buttons {% #The2 %}

The Learning feature includes three tools that can help you understand Amelia's performance. Each has a button on the left edge of the Learning workspaces.

### Intent Learning

Click this button to display performance data for a selected date range. A chart displays rates for intent recognition, resolutions, abandoned conversations, and escalated conversations. And it displays the total conversation volume for a date range. You also can export these metrics.

The Intent Learning panel also displays performance data for responders and intents for a date range.

### Abandoned Remediations

This workspace helps identify problem locations in conversations. The Abandoned Remediations panel lists conversation flows with abandoned conversations. Clicking a listed conversation flow shows where users left a conversation. Along with the number of abandonment events for each block in a flow.
