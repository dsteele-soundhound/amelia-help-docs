# Learning Workspace Introduction

## Introduction

The Learning Workspace provide tools to evaluate the performance of conversation flows. For example, to see where people succeed and fail in a conversation. Other tools provide insights into how well Amelia detects intents. There's also Amelia generated conversation flows based on prior escalations.

Our [Learning Workspace Walkthrough](B07-00_0002-Learning-Workspace-Walkthrough.md) topic describes these features in more detail.

##Included Learning Workspace Data and Features {% #Included %}

The Learning workspaces include a range of data and features. You can explore conversation performance in detail. Here's a high-level view of data you can browse.

* **Intent Learning**: This workspace displays conversation performance for a selected date range. A chart displays rates for intent recognition, resolutions, abandoned conversations, and escalated conversations. And it displays the total conversation volume for a date range. You also can export these metrics.
* **Abandoned Remediations**: Use this workspace to identify problem locations in conversations. Conversation flows show where users left a conversation. Along with the number of abandonment events for each block in a flow.
* **%B07-Learning.Escalation.Learning.feature**%:This workspace displays conversation flows Amelia creates after observing escalations. You can edit, save, deploy (if saved), or delete the proposed flow.
