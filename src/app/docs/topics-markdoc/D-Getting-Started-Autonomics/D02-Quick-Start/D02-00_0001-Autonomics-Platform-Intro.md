# Autonomics Platform Introduction

## Introduction

Enterprise IT systems manage thousands of daily events, incidents, requests, and changes. Amelia Autonomics helps IT leaders who rely on manual labor to manage their systems.

With generative AI embedded in its core, Autonomics creates processes and automations automatically. Using customer Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) speeds up time to resolution. This reduces errors, downtime, and labor costs.

Autonomics extracts the full power of your IT stack. Generative AI engines develop fast and easy automations to monitor and manage your IT ecosystem. The result is almost instantaneous self-improving resolutions. This is the opposite of human-centric IT practices.

## IT Operations History

Many IT operations rely on manual workflows that require significant human effort. This leads to inconsistent approaches to solving problems and applying solutions. Two technicians may solve a problem in two different ways. This can lead to variable repair times and outcomes. But the bigger problem is a lack of focus on root causes. Fixes only provide temporary relief. They can fail to prevent future occurrences, increasing the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR).

Automation can help address human-centered issues within IT operations. Autonomics excels at handling repetitive, high-volume, and complex tasks. This allows humans to guide the automation platform. They can evaluate the risks and rewards of various automations and processes.

### Automate with AI

The Autonomics platform deeply integrates generative AI. This revolutionizes IT automation workflows. You can turn Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) into intelligent self-executing automations. Your IT organization can adapt, scale, and innovate more effectively. The platform also includes strong governance. You maintain control over your automation processes. This ensures compliance and alignment with your organizational policies.

Autonomics intelligently mines knowledge articles in sources like ServiceNow® and Atlassian® Confluence. This creates context-rich knowledge bases and dynamic automations. Continuous knowledge integration reduces manual labor. And it ensures evolving SOPs quickly transform into responsive automated actions.

Once created, you can edit, test, and deploy automations in the same workspace. Integrating generative AI with rapid automation development optimizes the creation process. This lets your IT teams focus on higher priority tasks. Automations handle routine operations.

Amelia Autonomics combines knowledge management and automation in a single platform. It transforms your IT operations. You get reduced response times and improved accuracy. It empowers your teams to deliver proactive resilient IT services.

### Resolve with AI

Amelia Autonomics give IT teams a powerful ally resolving issues with generative AI. You can enable faster more efficient incident management and issue resolution. IT teams can do more than navigate and remediate incidents. They can proactively identify automation opportunities. Then use Autonomics to streamline repetitive tasks and improve service delivery. Autonomics leverages your company SOPs to triage, respond to, and resolve incoming tickets. This ensures all actions align with your established protocols. You can enhance compliance and consistency. And Autonomics can generate new SOPs and automations from recurring incidents. It leverages the Automate with AI engine to improve IT workflows continuously.

Beyond incident resolution, Autonomics captures, structures, and shares both content and context. It generates SOP and automation content. Including the specific situational parameters and context around each IT issue. This lets your IT Operations team create knowledge quickly and accurately. Knowledge creation is a natural extension of daily IT tasks. It's no longer an added responsibility for teams. It reduces burdens on already stretch IT Operations staff.

As you resolve incidents and complete requests, Autonomics creates new SOPs and automations. This makes knowledge creation an effortless byproduct of IT operations. Autonomics creates a dynamic up-to-date repository of actionable intelligence that grows and evolves.

Over time, IT teams move beyond reactive troubleshooting towards productive problem-solving. With insights and automation that adapt to your organization's needs.

### Integrations for Flexibility

Amelia Autonomics includes seamless native integration with a wide range of enterprise tools. This includes ServiceNow®. You get enhanced flexibility and expanded automation capabilities across your IT ecosystem. Equipped with pre-built plug-and-play integrations, Autonomics easily connects to essential platforms. This includes OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Office 365 Mail, Google Mail, Confluence, Zabbix, and others. These integrations work out of the box. You'll need minimal developer skills to set up and manage. IT teams can quickly deploy and benefit from Amelia's automation capabilities. Without the need for custom development or extensive training.

In addition, Autonomics includes robust support for standard webhooks. These provide real-time notifications as events occur or new data points and metrics appear. Real-time updates ensure that Autonomics stays in perfect sync with integrated platforms. IT teams gain immediate insights and notifications crucial for responsive incident management. By eliminating complex polling mechanisms, webhook support simplifies event-driven integration. It enables real-time responsiveness. And reduces the load on both system resources and developers.

Beyond notifications, Autonomics uses webhook-triggered events to fuel its automation workflows. Events initiate the appropriate responses, from triaging incidents to deploying remediations. Raising a high-priority ServiceNow® ticket can trigger Autonomics to triage and prioritize it using pre-defined SOPs. Without human intervention.

Automating these responses lets your IT teams maintain high levels of service continuity. It also minimizes response times and reduces the burden of repetitive tasks.

### Portable and Reusable Automations

The Autonomics Automata Engine has a matching engine and execution engine. Both work together to enable powerful flexibility and adaptability for automation workflows. Separating matching and execution lets you construct several matchers for one automation. Different platforms or sources could trigger the automation based on the incoming request. Matchers for ServiceNow®, ZenDesk, and BMC could trigger the same automation. The source of the match doesn't matter. Autonomics creates a seamless unified automation experience across diverse IT ecosystems.

This architecture makes automations portable and highly reusable. Automations determine connectivity and credentials at runtime. Automations are not tied to specific environments or platforms. This flexibility allows them to operate across various systems without modifications or configurations. The Automata Engine adapts to your evolving enterprise needs. It integrates easily with new platforms or changes to existing platforms. This ensures continuity and scaling across your organization.

Decoupling matching and execution allows updates to one system to not affect other systems. You can add or modify new matchers independently. This allows IT teams to extend their automations to reach to additional services. Or adapt to system updates with minimal disruption.

This modular approach reduces development time and operational risk. Autonomics adjusts to connectivity or credentialing changes dynamically. IT teams get robust automation practices that adapt to the demands of modern interconnected IT landscapes.

### Orchestration of Automation

Autonomics allows your IT team to streamline complex multi-system workflows. You can connect various tools and automate end-to-end processes. Native integrations with ServiceNow®, Office 365, Google Mail, Atlassian® Confluence, and Zabbix let you reach across organizational silos. This ensures seamless coordination across each part of an IT system. Orchestrations can pull data from one system, execute actions in another, and alert stakeholders. Autonomics creates a unified efficient process to enhance productivity and responsiveness.

The orchestration engine has dynamic workflow and conditional logic built in. The engine adapts based on real-time data and system states. Conditional logic lets Autonomics make decisions within workflows. For example, rerouting traffic or escalating an issue. Each action is relevant and timely. This flexibility also supports event-driven triggers. Workflows can start instantly when key events trigger in integrated systems. With webhooks providing real-time notifications, Autonomics enables responsive event-based automation. It keeps IT Operations proactive rather than reactive.

Autonomics also provides error-handling and monitoring tools. These ensure resilience and visibility within orchestrations. If an error occurs, the platform triggers self-healing actions. Or retries processes as needed. This minimizes downtime and reduces the need for manual intervention. Comprehensive monitoring and audit trails give insight into orchestration performance and execution history. It makes it easy to provide continuous optimization and transparency.

Together these orchestration features transform Autonomics into a powerful tool for IT Operations. Your teams can respond faster and reduce service interruptions. They can build scalable adaptive automation strategies across complex IT environments.
