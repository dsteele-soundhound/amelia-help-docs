# Light and Dark Mode

## Introduction

The Autonomics application offers two modes for displaying content and data. You can choose between a light mode theme or dark mode theme. It's your choice which one you prefer. Light mode displays text with a white background. Dark mode displays with a black background. Light mode is bright and clear. Dark mode is more calming and easy on the eyes. In addition, offering both modes can help with accessibility.
