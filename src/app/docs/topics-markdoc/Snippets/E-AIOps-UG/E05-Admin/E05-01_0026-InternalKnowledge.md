The Internal Knowledge feature is designed to help organisations lacking an established knowledge base to get started with automation quickly. Built on XWiki, this option is basic by design. It is not intended to replace robust platforms like ServiceNow or Confluence. Instead, it offers a foundational solution for users who do not yet have a knowledge repository.
