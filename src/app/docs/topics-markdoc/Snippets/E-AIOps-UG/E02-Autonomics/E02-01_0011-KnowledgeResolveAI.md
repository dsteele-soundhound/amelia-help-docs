Tasks include a Resolve with AI button. Clicking this button displays a right side panel titled Resolve with AI. If the task title is a command, that's used as a prompt.

The generative AI response then displays possible resolutions based on stored Knowledge sources. If the response has actionable information, you also can create an automation. Click the Generate button at the bottom of the right side panel. Or type prompts in the field also at the bottom of the panel. This panel leverages Autonomics knowledge to help resolve tasks.
