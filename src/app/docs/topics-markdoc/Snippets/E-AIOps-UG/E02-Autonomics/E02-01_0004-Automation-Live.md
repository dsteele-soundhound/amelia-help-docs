An automation can be either live or inactive (not live).

Use the Automation Studio Properties to mark your automation as live. Mark your automation as live, unless it's a disabled change request. Remember, you can only run live automations.

Visual indicators are a quick way to see is an automation is live or not. Live automations show a green dot indicator. Inactive automations show a gray dot indicator.
