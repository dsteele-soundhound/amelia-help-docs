The Host Command action is an intermediate step in your Autonomics automation workflow. Autonomics performs actions in the order that you add them to each automation---top to bottom or left to right. It is an optional action in the automation.

Host Command action is used to execute commands on remote hosts. It requires a predefined Automation connection, which the user must set up in advance. Each Host Command action uses one of these connections to connect to a remote host and execute the specified commands, enabling remote management and automation of tasks across multiple systems.
