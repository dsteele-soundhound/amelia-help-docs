The Automations module is your center for creating and managing automations. It can also integrate with third-party tools and applications to orchestrate end-to-end IT processes. These automations can exist in different domains and can vary in complexity.

You'll typically use the Automations module for:

* Self-service support. For example, checking the current status of an application or process. Or, for restarting an application or process.

* Code deployment.

* User requests. For example, requesting a password reset or requesting account access.

* Automatic phone escalations for alerts.
