The Script action is the intermediate step in your Autonomics automation workflow. Autonomics performs actions in the order that you add them to each automation---top to bottom or left to right. It is an optional action in the automation.

Script action in Autonomics allows the execution of custom scripts, including JavaScript, to perform various tasks and automations. We provide two different script engines to accommodate different scripting needs and preferences. These engines enable users to write and run custom code directly within the Autonomics platform, enhancing its functionality and flexibility.
