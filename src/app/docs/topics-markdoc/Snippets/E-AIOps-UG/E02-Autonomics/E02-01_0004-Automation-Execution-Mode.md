Sets how the automation runs.

* Automatic: Verifies that the automaton matches appropriate events or tickets and doesn't match inappropriate events for the type of automation. Handle automations with care, especially those involving ticketing events and when other automations are already running.

* Manual: An automation may or may not match an event. Set Scheduling and escalation-type automations to manual.
