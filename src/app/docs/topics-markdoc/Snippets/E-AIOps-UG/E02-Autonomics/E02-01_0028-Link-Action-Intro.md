The Link action lets you connect other automation processes in an automation, so you can create more complex workflows. By connecting automations, you can reuse previous ones, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.

The Link action is the intermediate step in your automation workflow. It's executed as part of the main process, allowing Autonomics to pass in or extract variables. Links can be many and deep, but recursion isn't supported. The return code from a link state is always 0.
