The AIOps API action lets you connect Autonomics API resources in an automation, so you can create more complex workflows. By connecting APIs and their methods, you can expand the features and data available to an automation.

The AIOps API action is the intermediate step in your automation workflow. It's executed as part of the main process, allowing Autonomics to pass in or extract variables.

When you manually create an automation in Automation Studio, Autonomics adds a Start and a Success action. You can then add one or more AIOps API actions between these points to develop your automation. Autonomics performs actions in the order that you add them to each automation---top to bottom or left to right. It's an optional action in the automation.
