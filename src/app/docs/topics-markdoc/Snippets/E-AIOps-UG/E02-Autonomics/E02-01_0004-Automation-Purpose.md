You define the purpose of the automation at the time of creation based on how you'll use it.

* Diagnosis: This type may verify the problem's existence and collects diagnostic data from event logs or system login records. The information is then sent back to the client or engineer for manual processing. See the [ITIL definition for Incident Investigation and Diagnosis](http://itsm.certification.info/incidentinvestdiag.html) for more information.

* Maintenance: This type is reactive and is for change management processes.

* Process: This type is reactive and relates to an overall process. This is usually a process within a process to notify, approve, calculate, or assess a resource.

* Remediation: This type logs onto the affected system or systems and takes the steps to fix the problem. For example, restarting a process or clearing disk space. See the [ITIL definition for Remediate](http://itsm.certification.info/remediation.html) for more information.

* Routine: This type actively performs a task on a regular and repeated schedule. For example, validating that a resource is live.

* Verification: This type interrogates and verifies the status or condition of a resource.

This setting is for reporting only and doesn't impact automation performance.
