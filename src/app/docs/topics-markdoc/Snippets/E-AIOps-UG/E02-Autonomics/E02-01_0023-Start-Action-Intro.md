The Start action is the first step in your automation, just like the Noop action. But, the Start action differs from the Noop action in that the Start action has a single input and output. Despite having a single input, you can initiate a Start action using various methods, such as scheduled times, specific events, or manual activation.

Autonomics performs actions in the order that you add them to each automation---top to bottom or left to right. Because of this, a Start action is the first action performed. Each automation must have a start-type action to be successful.

When you manually create an automation using Automation Studio, Autonomics adds a Start and a Success action to help you get started. You can then add actions between these points to develop your automation.
