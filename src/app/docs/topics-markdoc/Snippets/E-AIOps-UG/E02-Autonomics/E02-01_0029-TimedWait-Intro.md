The TimedWait action is the intermediate step in your Autonomics automation workflow. Autonomics performs actions in the order that you add them to each automation---top to bottom or left to right. It is an optional action in the automation.

TimedWait action in Autonomics allows you to pause the execution of a workflow. This is useful for scenarios where you need to wait for time-consuming operations to complete before proceeding, or when you need to introduce a delay before repeating an operation. By specifying a wait time, you can ensure that subsequent actions occur only after the necessary conditions are met, such as the completion of a task or a predefined time interval.
