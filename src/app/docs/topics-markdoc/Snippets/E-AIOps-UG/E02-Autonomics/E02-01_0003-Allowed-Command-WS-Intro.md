You'll use the Allowed Commands workspace during a "Resolve with AI" session for a ticket. In this session, Autonomics may suggest running a command on relevant hosts. You need to know the command's impact before making a decision. This workspace stores all user-approved commands. AI can run them in future "Resolve with AI" sessions without needing another review.
