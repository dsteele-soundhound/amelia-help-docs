As the name implies, theAutonomics Match & Merge workspace lets you manage matched and merged automations. The Automations module watches and records your engineers' automation work. It studies these recordings to match similar automations. You can then merge these automations using the Autonomics Match & Merge workspace. This is great if you have engineers creating similar tasks and using similar commands, like restarting a service.
