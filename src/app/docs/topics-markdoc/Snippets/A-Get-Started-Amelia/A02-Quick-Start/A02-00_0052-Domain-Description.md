Domains help organize knowledge, users, groups, roles, escalation teams, and other systems. The global domain acts as the parent, with one or more child domains. This setup lets you make updates and changes without affecting the global domain. So, if your global domain holds Amelia's default personality and training, you can create child domains to organize knowledge. For example, child domains can include active responders, greetings, and scripted response behaviors before Amelia moves the conversation forward or ends it. You can also use child domains for specific purposes like languages, time zones, default escalation queues, and text-to-speech.
