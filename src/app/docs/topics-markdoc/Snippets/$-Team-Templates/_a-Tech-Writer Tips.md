--TECH WRITER TIPS--

* Hyperlinks: Set the Target Frame as "Same Frame" for What You'll Learn hyperlinks and "New Window/Tab" for Other Resources hyperlinks.

* Hyperlinks: For What You'll Learn hyperlinks, include a period AFTER the hyperlink. The period must NOT form part of the hyperlink.

* Abbreviations: Show the abbreviation first followed by the definition in brackets. For example "LLM (large language model)" or "CSV (comma separated value)". Only show the definition on the first instance of the abbreviation.

* UI Elements: Refer to UI elements like the following ( ![B03-04-DEB-Btn-Plus](B03-04-DEB-Btn-Plus.png){width="25" style="inline"}, ![B03-04-DEB-Btn-Flow-Del](B03-04-DEB-Btn-Flow-Del.png){width="25" style="inline"} or ![B03-04-DEB-Btn-Top-Deploy](B03-04-DEB-Btn-Top-Deploy.png){width="25" style="inline"}) as buttons NOT icons. It's rare that you'll click on an icon. Typically, a button may/will include an icon image but the clickable element is a button.

* UI Elements: Avoid over-naming UI elements. For example, refer to the "Basic tab", rather than the "Basic tab panel".

* Assets: Store assets (images and snippets) in the asset folder associated with your topic. For example, if your topic number is B03-06_0123, you'll store your assets in the B03-Digital-Employees folder. And if your topic number is E02-01_0123, you'll store your assets in the E02-Autonomics folder.

* Assets: Be mindful of topic numbers and ensure that you include the complete 4-digit sequence number as part of the asset name.

* Spaces Between Words: If you apply a variable followed by a styled element or apply two variables side-by-side. Preview your content to validate that Flare is applying the correct spacing between words. If words appear without spaces, insert a non-breaking space in the XML editor between the words as follows: &#xA0;

* Content: Avoid wordiness and complex words. Replace phrases like "allows you to" with "lets you". If in doubt, refer to the Word List at the end of our Style Guide.

* Content: Write in an informal, relaxed and conversational way to increase engagement and make content easier to read. To do this, keep sentences short, use active voice, write in the second person, and use contractions.
