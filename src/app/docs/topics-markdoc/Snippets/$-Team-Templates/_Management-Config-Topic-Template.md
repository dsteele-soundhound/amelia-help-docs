# [Name] Management/Configuration

## Introduction

NOTE TO WRITERS: Management topics are a collection of step procedures that describe how to create, edit, search, import, export, and other specific actions. How to access the workspace often is located before the What You'll Learn section. But it also might be part of the workspace section directly below the What You'll Learn section. The step procedures are short, direct, and uncluttered. Here's an example:

The full intro paragraph(s) might be a snippet from the Introduction section from the Introduction topic. And/or a snippet used on a page that lists a bunch of related topics like entities, intents, etc. As with the Walkthrough topic, tweak the last two paragraphs, including obviously removing the double quotes. And be sure to link to the Introduction topic for this feature.

[Full Intro]

"To use [Name] to ..., you must understand their features and how to configure them. This topic gives insights into when and how to use entities.

See the [Name] Introduction topic for a high-level introduction to ...."

## Access the [[Name] Panel] / [[Name] Workspace]

NOTE TO WRITERS: Use a snippet shared with the Introduction and/or Management topics. The access instructions here need to include a screen shot because you need to situate the reader in a particular place. Also, this section could include a screen shot and table description of any panel and workspace that appears once the reader is logged in.

To access the [Name] panel:

1.    Instruction 1

2. Instruction 2

3. Instruction 3

### The [Name] Panel

 

### The [Name] Workspace

 

## Add a/an [Name]

NOTE TO WRITERS: These step procedures should be in a rote format with copy limited to only what is essential and/or likely to cause confusion. There are different ways to organize step procedures. Below is one example. Once you find a way that works for the content, repeat it for all these procedures. Repetition will help the reader identify what changes between step procedures.

 

To add a [Name]:

1. At the top left of the [Name] panel, click Add New. A New [Name] page opens after the Home page.

   Open this dropdown to learn about the elements you'll see when adding a model.
