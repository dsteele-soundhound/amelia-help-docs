## Included [Name] Workspace Data and Features

NOTE TO WRITERS: A high level view of features or workspaces might include useful information that can't be fit into a Management topic. Use H3 headings for each feature, workspace, or topic. Or use bullet points with the feature name in bold. Each feature is described in 1-2 short paragraphs with a link to either a Walkthrough topic or a Management topic for more information.
