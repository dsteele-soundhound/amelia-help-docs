Click to select whether to normalize, extract only, or perform both processes using this normalizer. For example, if using a trained entity tagger, you can normalize the resulting spans when using the Normalize option.

* Normalize: Only normalize. Using this option, you must train an entity extractor.

* Extract and Normalize: Extract and normalize results using a normalizer.

* Extract Only: Use a lookup to extract values but do not perform normalization.
