For role entities where Role Type is set to Yes, click the + Add button to add child entities. The new child entities will appear in the Entities panel located on the left side of the NLU Comprehension Entities works paces.

Clicking a child entity to display the edit workspace, and then clicking the Properties tab, will display a Parent Entity setting instead of the Child Roles setting.
