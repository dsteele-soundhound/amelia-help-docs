 If Amelia can't provide a complete response or doesn't respond at all, try troubleshooting. First, check your segments using the source editor. If that fails, lower the Segment Selection Threshold, or increase the Number of Segments Used to Generate Answers setting. See [Settings Configuration](B10-06_0003-Settings-Configuration.md) for more information.
