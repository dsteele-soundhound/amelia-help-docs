To schedule a knowledge source refresh:

1. In the **Sources** panel, find and select the knowledge source you'd like to schedule for refresh.

2. In the knowledge source editor, open the ![B04-01_0002-AA-Refresh-Dropdown](B04-01_0002-AA-Refresh-Dropdown.png){width="25" style="inline"} dropdown.

4. From the **Trigger Type** dropdown, select one of the following options: **Simple, Periodic or Cron**.
