Selecting Yes sets Amelia to generate QA pairs and to ingest the document into Amelia Answers. If Generate QA Pairs is set to No, Amelia won't create QA pairs. QA Pairs don't stop the system from generating responses dynamically. They exist as a first line of defense. If QA pairs exist, Amelia uses these first. If Amelia can't get the answer from QA pairs, then Amelia fetches responses dynamically from the source.
