Clicking a segment row opens a new segment panel on the right of the page. This panel shows segment information, including create date, created by, and modification details. The rest of the panel shows expanded segment details and the associated QA pairs.

For website and Integration-type sources, clicking a QA pair takes you to the QA Pairs page. Inside the page, the QA Pair panel opens on the right, showing the selected QA pair.
