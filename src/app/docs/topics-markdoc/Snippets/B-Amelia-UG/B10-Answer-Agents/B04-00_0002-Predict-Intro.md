The Predict tool helps you test your Amelia Answers setup. It shows what Amelia Answers knows and how Amelia will respond to your users.

After entering your question and clicking Predict, the tool returns a range of results. These results help you understand how Amelia processes the utterance. You'll also see a score for each QA pair result. This can help you decide what thresholds to apply in Settings and how many results you want to show. Besides Intents, Entities, and QA details, you'll also see System NLP results (natural language processing). These NLP results give insight into sentiment, toxicity, and other subtle processing cues. Down the page, you'll also see results for Domain Switch, and Semantics.

After generating a prediction, you can filter the results in a few ways. For example, filter by Prompt Entity, Scope Intent, Language or select the Use Predicted Domain for FAQ setting.
