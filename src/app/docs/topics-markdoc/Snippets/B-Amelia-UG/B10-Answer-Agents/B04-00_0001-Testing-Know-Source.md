Understanding how your users interact with Amelia and conversation outcomes is key. And Amelia Answers puts you in control of tracking knowledge delivery and feedback. To support this, Amelia Answers offers several tools to let you filter and analyze your response data. The Tests tool looks at batches of questions and answers as XLSX files. And the Predict tool tests individual utterances. These tools present live data on response likes and dislikes, question rate, answer accuracy, response time, and more.
