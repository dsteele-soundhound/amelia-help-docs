Amelia's AI Agents feature uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand user goals from utterances. Then orchestrates cognitive agents to perform tasks to achieve one or more goals. These agents include one or more functions used to accomplish tasks.

You can build cognitive functions with Web Actions, Conversation AI flows, or integration flows. These artifacts manage conversation flows and interact with third-party resources.
