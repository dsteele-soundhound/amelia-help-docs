Amelia's Agentic AI feature uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand user goals from utterances. Then orchestrates cognitive agents to perform tasks to achieve one or more goals.

Each cognitive agent includes a mix of sources, functions, and knowledge to perform a task. The Cognitive Agents workspace lets you add and define each of these elements. The workspace also includes the ability to test and debug the agent.

You can build cognitive agents from scratch. Or start with a library of pre-configured agents.
