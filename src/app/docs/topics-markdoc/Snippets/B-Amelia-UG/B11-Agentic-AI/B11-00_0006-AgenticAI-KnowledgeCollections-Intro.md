Amelia's AI Agents feature uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand user goals from utterances. Then orchestrates cognitive agents to perform tasks to achieve one or more goals. These agents include one or more Knowledge Collections to give users important information. For example, if a person asks about return policies.

You can upload Word or PDF files with operational procedures. Or create Document FAQs. It's critical this information be directly related to agent tasks. This helps the LLM identify useful information.
