To access Escalation Teams workspace:

1. From the top left main navigation menu, click Contact Center.

2. On the left edge, click the Escalation Teams button.

3. Click either the Escalation Teams or Global Escalation Teams link from the flyout menu that displays.

   > Escalation Teams can be designated as global or assigned to a domain. A global team will be allowed to service any queue in any domain. A team assigned to a domain may only be assigned queues in that same domain. Should queue or team domain classification change, some relationships may be removed in the process.
