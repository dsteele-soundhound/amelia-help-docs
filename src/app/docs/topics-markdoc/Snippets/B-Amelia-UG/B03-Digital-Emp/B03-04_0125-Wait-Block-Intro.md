The Wait block pauses a conversation at its current point until a condition is met. These conditions can be either duration- or signal-based. A duration-based wait means the block pauses the conversation flow based on specific date or time values. A signal-based wait means the block pauses the flow until it receives a specific signal.

You can use the Wait block in various scenarios. For instance, waiting for file/document upload, ticket number assignment, or assignee as part of a service desk inquiry.

The block can access entity values and other variables. You can include output variables using the ${variable_name} JEXL syntax format. Also, you can use the Wait block with HTML markup language.
