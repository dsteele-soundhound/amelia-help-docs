The Split block doesn't function like other blocks. Instead of adding a new block to your conversation flow, it adds a block of space to your conversation flow. By default, the blocks in the Builder workspace are visually connected to each other. This block splits two visually connected blocks with an arrow between them. The arrow between indicates a flow connection. Splitting your conversation flow helps you identify the specific actions or purposes of different parts of your flow.
