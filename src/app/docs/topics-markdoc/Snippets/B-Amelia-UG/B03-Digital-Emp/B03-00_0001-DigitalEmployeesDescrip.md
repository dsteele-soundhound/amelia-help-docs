The Digital Employees builder, or DEB, uses natural conversation to help you create repeatable processes or flows. These flows typically complete one or more tasks, such as handling personal banking. Amelia also gathers information or lessons from the conversation flows that you define. You can configure data needed to complete the user goal or intent. It's also possible to define integrations with third-party resources. You don't need to have much technical knowledge to use the builder. Non-technical staff can use placeholders, and more technical staff can handle the final integration.
