The Card block lets you add a pre-configured Adaptive Card to a conversation flow. Adaptive Cards are highly customizable. They can contain any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields. Injecting your actionable content into Amelia's conversation flow increases engagement and efficiency.

You'll start by creating your Adaptive Cards using the Custom Cards feature. To access Custom Cards, you'll go to Digital Employees > Conversation Flows. Once set up, you're ready to use your Adaptive Card in a chat conversation or in the chat interface.
