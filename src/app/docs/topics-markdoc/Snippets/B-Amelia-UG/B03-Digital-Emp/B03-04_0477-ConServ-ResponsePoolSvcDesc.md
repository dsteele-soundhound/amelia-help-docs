Response pools hold response pool entries. And, response pool entries are sentences Amelia randomly selects for specific purposes. To greet users, for example, a greeting response pool might have many greetings. Amelia would select a greeting for the start of each conversation. You also can use tags to organize entries. For example, tags named Voice and Web could organize entries by Amelia interface.

Response groups organize response pools. After creating a group and a pool, you'll create entries with possible responses.
