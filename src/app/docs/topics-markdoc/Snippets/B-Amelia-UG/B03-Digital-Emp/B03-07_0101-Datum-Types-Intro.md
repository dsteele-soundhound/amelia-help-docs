Datums are tools for extracting data from user utterances in conversations. For example, if you need a password reset, Amelia needs your user information to start the process. Amelia can get your user information from a short conversation, use it to check your account, and then make and send a temporary password.

A wide range of datums exist. The most common datums---for example, addresses and dates---are built-in and pre-configured. Other datums can be customized.
