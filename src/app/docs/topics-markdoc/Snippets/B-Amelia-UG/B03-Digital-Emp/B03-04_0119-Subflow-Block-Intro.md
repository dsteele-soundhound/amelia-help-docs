Subflow blocks let you easily integrate separate conversation flows into your current conversation. Essentially, a subflow is a small section of code that you can extract from the main flow. You can use either your domain or the global domain as the source for your subflow. Additionally, you can use either Digital Employees builder flows or BPNs (business process network) flows as your source.

Subflow blocks are particularly useful when building long and complex conversation flows. Your teams can work on different parts of the flow simultaneously, giving each a smaller focus. You can also test your subflows more quickly, speeding up the development process.

Another advantage of subflows is that they allow for reusable code. These conversation flow snippets end the need for unnecessary duplication.
