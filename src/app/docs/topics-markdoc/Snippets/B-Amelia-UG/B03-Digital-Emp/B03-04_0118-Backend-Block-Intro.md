The Backend block allows interactions with third-party resources. You can use the block to bring in a web action, automation, or integration flow. You can also use the block as a placeholder to mock up a conversation flow for testing purposes.

A practical application for using the block could be retrieving a ticket number from your customer support system or fetching employee status from your HR system. Anyone can set up details about what data to send to a third-party resource and what data to return. A technical resource then comes in later to set up the connection details.
