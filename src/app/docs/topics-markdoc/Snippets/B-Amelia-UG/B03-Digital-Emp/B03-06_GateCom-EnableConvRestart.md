Lets your end user restart a conversation with a designated restart conversation message. This setting works by closing the existing conversation with Amelia and starting a new one immediately. Set to Yes to enable or No to disable.

Customize the message using the User Restart Conversation Message setting.

The Disable Greeting setting has no effect on the newly started conversation.The gateway won't suppress messages sent from Amelia when starting the new conversation.
