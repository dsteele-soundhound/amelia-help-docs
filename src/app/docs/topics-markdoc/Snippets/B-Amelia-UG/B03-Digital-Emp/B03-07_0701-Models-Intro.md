A model is a program trained to recognize patterns or make decisions without human intervention. Artificial intelligence models use algorithms and data to perform specific tasks. Amelia identifies intents and entities either by training a model or using an LLM (large language model).

Training a model uses intents, entities, and other data to create a representational model about a topic. Words and phrases in the model will or won't match words in conversations. Matches indicate an entity or intent exists in a conversation. Amelia includes built-in machine learning algorithms used to train models. Amelia uses the model to parse real-time conversations.

There are two different types of models:

* Intent Models: These use machine learning algorithms optimized to recognize intents in utterances.

* Entity Models: These also use utterances and algorithms to train models to identify entities. Some algorithms need a gazetteer, a look-up list of possible entities like city names or days of the week.
