<snippet id="B03-04_0117-User-Utterance-Block-Intro_snippet">



This block lets you include a pre-defined user statement into a process flow. For instance, to initiate an internal process, you can add the trigger as a User Utterance block statement. The user utterance becomes an invisible statement communicated directly to Amelia. The user won't see or hear the utterance, but Amelia will receive it.
