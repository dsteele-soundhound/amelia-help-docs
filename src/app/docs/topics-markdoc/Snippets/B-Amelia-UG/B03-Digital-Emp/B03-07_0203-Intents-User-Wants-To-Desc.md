Amelia will use this phrase to describe the intent to the user when:

* Confirming that the user wants to execute the intent.

* Disambiguating between this intent and another intent.

* Continuing into a second intent in cases of multi-intent execution.

Enter the phrase as a variable describing what the user would want to do in this intent. If the phrase is "reset a password," Amelia will ask questions like, "Do you want to continue to reset a password?" or say, "I understand you also want to reset a password."
