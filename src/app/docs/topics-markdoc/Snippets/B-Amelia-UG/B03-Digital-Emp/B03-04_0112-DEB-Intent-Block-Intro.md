The first block that appears at the top of any conversation flow is the Intent block. Its purpose is to set the action, goal, or response you're trying to achieve with the conversation flow.

To create an Intent block, you need to provide a user utterance that defines your intention. Once you've provided the user utterance, Amelia generates a response. You can then set properties for the Intent block. This includes choosing to use a new or existing intent as the Intent Source.
