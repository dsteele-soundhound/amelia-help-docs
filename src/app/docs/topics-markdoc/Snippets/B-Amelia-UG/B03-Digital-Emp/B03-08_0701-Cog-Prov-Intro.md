Amelia uses LLMs (Large Language Models) for a few key features. LLMs help enhance accuracy and ease of use. For example, they can replace training Machine Learning models that need utterances. And the Langchain version of Amelia Answers requires an LLM connection.

The Cognitive Providers workspace lets you enable and manage LLMs within  Amelia. To use any of Amelia's LLM functionality, you must configure at least one cognitive provider. Amelia supports OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and internal LLMs. We recommend Azure OpenAI for most use cases.
