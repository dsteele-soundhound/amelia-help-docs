Property sets are collections of variables used in integration flows. Variables can contain information for hosts, ports, credentials, API paths, and other details. As with integration assets, you can define property sets in an integration flow. Or define them as a collection available to all flows.

> You can encrypt property set variables, if needed. Encrypted property set variables do not display their values in administration workspaces. {style="note"}
