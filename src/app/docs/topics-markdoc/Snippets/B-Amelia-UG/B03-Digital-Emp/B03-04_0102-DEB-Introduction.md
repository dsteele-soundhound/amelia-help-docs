The Digital Employees builder, or DEB, uses natural conversation to help you build repeatable process flows. These flows typically complete one or more tasks, such as handling personal banking. Amelia also gathers information from conversations using the conversation flows that you define. Using the builder, you'll define data to identify and complete the user goal or intent. It's also possible to define integrations with third-party resources. Minimal technical knowledge is required. So, non-technical staff can use placeholders with the final integration handled by more technical staff.

On the left of the builder interface, is a Conversation Flows panel to organize your flows. The builder also includes a center canvas to create and edit flows. The top and right edge of the canvas showcases various tools used in building your flows.
