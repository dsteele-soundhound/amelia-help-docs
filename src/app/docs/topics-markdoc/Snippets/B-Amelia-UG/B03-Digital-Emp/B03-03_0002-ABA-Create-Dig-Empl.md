The Amelia Builds Amelia workspace gives several ways to create digital employees. The first step is to choose how to create the employee. Your options include using a catalog, prompt, chat, or uploading documents and transcripts. Amelia then processes the inputs and creates all the artifacts needed.

When finished, the Digital Employees builder will appear. You can use the Digital Employees builder to make any changes to the conversation flow, configure third-party connections, and test your new employee.
