This block lets you ask users to upload one or more files as part of a conversation flow. You'll use this block when you need to collect information. An example use case could be to ask new employees to upload their photographs for their access cards. You can use files uploaded to Amelia's Content Manager or a locally stored variable pointing to an existing file. It's important to keep the resource's size under 50 MB.
