How often, in seconds, the agents created for this integration will update their status in Amelia to Ready.

This update interval serves to keep agents online and available to receive escalation requests from Amelia. Outside processes or admin users may set the agent's availability to offline without the gateway's knowledge. This update interval ensures that the agents are always online when the integration is deployed.
