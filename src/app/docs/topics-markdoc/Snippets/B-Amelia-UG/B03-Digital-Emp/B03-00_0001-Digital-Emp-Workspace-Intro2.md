When you select Digital Employees From the **top left main** menu, the left-side menu and Home tab appear.

The left-side menu links to specific features used to create conversation flows. Hovering over each button displays a flyout menu with more options. For example, the Integrations button provides a link to Gateway Integrations tools. These tools connect Amelia with Zendesk, Teams, and other third-party chat software.

The Home tab includes a series of cards. These cards display data from tools used to create and manage conversations. They also provide links to use specific tools and work in progress. For example, the Test User Utterances (Predict) card has an input field to test possible user utterances. Type an utterance to show what Amelia-related elements trigger.
