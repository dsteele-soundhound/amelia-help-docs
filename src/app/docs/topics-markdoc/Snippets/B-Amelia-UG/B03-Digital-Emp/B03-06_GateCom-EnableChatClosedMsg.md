Sets whether to send a conversation closed message to your end-user when the conversation closes. Set to Yes to enable or No to disable.

Most gateways won't send this message if the conversation closes due to an inactivity timeout and the Chat Timeout Message is enabled. It's also usually not sent if your end-user specifically closes the conversation.

Customize the message using the Chat Closed Message setting.
