Response pools are a collection of sentences. Amelia uses pools to randomly select responses for specific purposes. To greet users, a greeting response pool might have many possible responses. Amelia would select a greeting for the start of each interaction. If Amelia cannot find an expected response at the domain level, the application will look at the global response pool.
