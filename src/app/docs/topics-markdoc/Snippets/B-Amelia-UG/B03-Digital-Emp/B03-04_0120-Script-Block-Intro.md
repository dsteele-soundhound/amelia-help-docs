The Script block is one of Amelia's most used blocks. This block provides an editor and settings for using code to process data as part of a conversation flow. This tool comes in handy when customizing a conversation flow or creating variables. You can also use the Script block to add custom metrics to reports.

You'll write code for the Script block using the Groovy programming language. And besides anything Groovy can do, you also have access to Amelia's internal operations.
