{% include from="B03-07_0301-Entities-Intro.md" element-id="B03-07_0301-Entities-Intro_snippet" /%} For example, to buy car insurance, a person must share their name and personal information. They also share the make, model, and year of their car. These essential data points are entities.

You can use entities to annotate chat transcripts and other training data. Amelia uses the resulting data to create a representational model about a topic. Words and phrases in the model match or don't match words in conversations. People use these words to define their goals and the data needed to achieve their goals. Matches show if an entity or intent exists in a conversation.

Each entity is extracted and evaluated to confirm the data is appropriate. For example, an entity with a value of 2024 is appropriate for an entity called year. A date is not appropriate for an entity that stores a person's name. Some entities also need normalization. For example, the terms Camaro and Chevy Camaro refer to the same model of car.
