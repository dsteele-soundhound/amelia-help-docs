When set, Amelia executes the process after the intent context completes. This assumes no suspended contexts exist. The selected process populates to the right of the Choose button.

When unset, Amelia returns to root context after the intent context completes. This assumes no suspended contexts exist.

If multiple contexts exist, Amelia will attempt to complete contexts sequentially. This setting applies only if all contexts complete. In that case, this setting applies for the last completed intent context.

If you've added the wrong process, click ![Delete_X-Btn-Amelia_Answers](Delete_X-Btn-Amelia_Answers.png){width="25" style="inline"} to clear the selected process. Then, you can revisit the Select Process modal to make a new selection.
