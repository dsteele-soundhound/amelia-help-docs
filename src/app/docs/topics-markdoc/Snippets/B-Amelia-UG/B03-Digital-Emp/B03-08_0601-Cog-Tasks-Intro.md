The Cognitive Task feature helps you control how Amelia uses LLMs. You can create individual LLM-related tasks to use with Amelia. When Amelia uses an LLM, your task can specify an LLM to use, the timeout threshold, and custom prompts if available. You also can test the connection for a task. For some tasks like entity extraction, you also must configure other parts of the Amelia application.
