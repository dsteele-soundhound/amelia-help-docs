* **Test and Validation Files**: This file has many utterances that express the intent. You can source utterances from conversation logs. Or, you can create them with a subject matter expert and similar sources. These files also should contain utterances designed to be more difficult for Amelia to connect with the intent.

* **Negative Test and Validation Files**: Contains utterances that clearly are not related to the intent. For example, this file might contain single words related to the intent. And it also might include examples with related words. For example, the utterance, "I'm king for a day" is never used to request a king sized hotel bed.  

  These files also should contain negative utterances designed to be more difficult for Amelia to connect with the intent.
