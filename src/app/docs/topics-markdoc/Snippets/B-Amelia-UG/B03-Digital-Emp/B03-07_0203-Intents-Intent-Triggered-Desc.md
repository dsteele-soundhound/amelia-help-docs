Defines the action Amelia will take.

* Use FAQ: When triggered, Amelia provides an FAQ answer. A box shows below where you can write in the language for the answer(s) Amelia will provide.

* Execute Process: When triggered, Amelia executes a conversation process or flow. Selecting this option displays a Choose button. Clicking this button shows the Select Process modal where you can select a single relevant process.

The selected process populates to the right of the Execute Process checkbox. If you've added the wrong process, click ![Delete_X-Btn-Amelia_Answers](Delete_X-Btn-Amelia_Answers.png){width="25" style="inline"} to clear the selected process. Then, you can revisit the Select Process modal to make a new selection.
