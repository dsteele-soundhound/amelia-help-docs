Like the Amelia Says block, the Amelia Asks block is one of Amelia's most used blocks. While the Amelia Says block gives information, the Amelia Asks block lets you ask general or entity-specific questions. For instance, if a user wants to buy a car, Amelia must gather information about the type of car, financing options, and other relevant details.

The Amelia Asks block is typically used to ask generic questions. Generic question formats can include:

* **Open-ended Questions**: These questions need more than a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer, and instead need your user to elaborate. For example, "Is there anything else that I can help you with?"

* **Closed-ended Questions**: These questions need predefined answers, such as "yes" or "no," multiple choice, or a rating scale. For example, "Do you have another question?"

* **Question Prompts**: These are a type of prompt used to generate responses to questions. For example, "Please tell me more."

Besides using an Amelia Asks block for generic questions, you can use the block with built-in entities or to draw from a response pool. Say you've created a custom data entity called DealershipName with the question, "What is the dealership name?". You can use this existing entity to let Amelia ask this question as part of the conversation flow.

You can also use the Amelia Asks block to integrate widgets into your conversation flow. Widgets let you add single- or multi-select button-type options, forms, or surveys. You can also use widgets to add autocomplete options and date range selection using date pickers. This variety increases engagement within your conversation flows.
