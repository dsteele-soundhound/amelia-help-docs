Enables or disables chat timeout for each conversation.

If set to Yes, the timeout value is set by the Chat Timeout Seconds setting. If there's no activity (no messages) for this amount of time, the conversation times out. On reaching the timeout, Amelia closes the conversation.

If set to No, the conversation timeout defaults to Amelia's conversation inactivity timeout. This is typically 1 hour.
