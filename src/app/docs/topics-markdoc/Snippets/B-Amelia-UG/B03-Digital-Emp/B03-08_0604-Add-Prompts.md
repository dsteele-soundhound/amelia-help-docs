To create a custom prompt, simply click on the + Add Prompt button and choose a type that aligns with your goal. You can use the tooltip to guide you through the available prompt types for your task type.

After selecting the type, add a System Prompt. This can include instructions, objectives, personality traits, roles, and tone guidelines. Next, you'll add a User Prompt. This should capture the entire scenario in a procedural and fully specified manner. It's important to separate conditional statements from actions and requests to ensure clarity.
