<snippet id="B03-04_0479-ConServ-ServiceSvc_snippet"> **Note:** The Service Operations connection service guides a conversation flow based on the outcomes of responders. Connections between block or task edges use this service to confirm a responder activated.

In a conversation, a series of responders evaluate all user utterances. For example, an FAQ responder triggers when the user asks a question. Every responder generates a score when evaluating a user utterance. These scores determine the response Amelia makes.

> You can only use these operations if the Phased Execution domain setting is active.
