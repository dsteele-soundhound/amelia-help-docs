Use this option to enable or suppress Amelia's first utterance. Choose No to enable Amelia's first utterance or Yes to suppress it.

When you suppress Amelia's first utterance, the user's first response will be Amelia's answer to their initial message. For example, this would be the user's query that started the conversation, such as "Can I open a bank account?"

If you are using a greeting Digital Employees builder flow or BPN process that sends multiple messages to the user, this setting only suppresses the first message. It doesn't suppress every message sent from the greeting BPN, nor does it disable its execution.
