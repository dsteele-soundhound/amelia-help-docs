Whether the information about the external agent should be customized. Default is No or unchecked.

Some external systems do not provide information about the agent who picked up a chat escalated by  Amelia. In these cases, Amelia simply uses the details of the Gateway Service as the agent info. If this is not desired, the Customized Agent Info can be used to override this outcome.

If Yes is selected, provide this additional information:

* Agent First Name: Type the default agent first name to use in conversations.

* Agent Last Name: Type the default agent last name to use in conversations.

* Agent Default Locale: Select the default locale to use in conversations.
