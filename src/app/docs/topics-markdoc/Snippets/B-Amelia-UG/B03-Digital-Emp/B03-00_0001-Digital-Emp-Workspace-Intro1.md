The AI Agents (Digital Employees) workspace is your starting point for working with conversation flows. It provides the tools to create and configure conversation flows. Once created, Amelia uses these flows to interact with users and help them achieve their goals.

With Amelia 7.0, you have two options to handle conversation flows. You can use AI agents for conversations or use deterministic conversation flows. AI agents use an orchestrator to call agents that perform specific tasks. The conversation context will determine which agents the orchestrator selects, and in what order.
