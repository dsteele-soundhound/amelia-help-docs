Define Amelia's behavior when the intent prediction confidence is low. For example, when the top scoring intent has a lower prediction score than the Intent Confirmation Threshold. Or there's ambiguity between the top scoring intent and the fallback intent using the Intent Ambiguity Threshold. Configure both of these settings in NLU Comprehension > Settings (NLU Settings).

* Ask a Confirmation Question: Amelia will ask a confirmation question when the intent prediction confidence is low.

* Execute the Intent Directly: Amelia will execute the intent context when the intent prediction confidence is low.
