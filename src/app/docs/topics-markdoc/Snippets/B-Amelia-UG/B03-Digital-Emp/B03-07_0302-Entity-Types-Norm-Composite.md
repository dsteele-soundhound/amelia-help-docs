Composite Datum Entities: These combine two or more entities. For example, to capture a date value that includes an integer and a month name. A user utterance might contain several integers. The utterance, "Reserve a table 26 March for 4 people at 6 pm," uses three integers. One integer for 26 March with two more integers used for 4 people at 6 pm on that date.
