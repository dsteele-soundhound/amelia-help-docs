The Dialog Act connection service provides access to the current dialog act used by Amelia. For example, when a user says "Thank you," Amelia responds with the Thanking dialog act by saying, "You're welcome." Dialog acts provide a way to describe the purpose of conversation exchanges. In addition to a Thanking dialog act, other examples are Apology, Go Back, and Repeat.
