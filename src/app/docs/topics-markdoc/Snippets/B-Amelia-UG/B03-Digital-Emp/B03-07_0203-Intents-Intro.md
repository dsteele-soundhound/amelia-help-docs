Intents serve two purposes: to identify intent in real-time conversations and to tag utterances used to train Amelia in the recognition of words that reveal user intent.

People chat with Amelia to perform tasks. For example, they want to reset a password or buy car insurance. What the person says in the conversation reveals their intent or goal. For example, "I lost my hotel bill. Can you send me a copy?" The clear intent here is to get a copy of their hotel bill.

In effect, Amelia looks first for the intent, or the reason for the conversation. Then, Amelia looks for the supporting data to complete or resolve the intent.
