Enabling this setting stops spoken delivery from the escalation response pool during transfer. This means there's no text-to-speech generated during the transfer.

A workaround is to have Amelia say &lt;prosody volume='silent'&gt;wait&lt;/prosody&gt; which will be silent. This must be part of the response pool to work.
