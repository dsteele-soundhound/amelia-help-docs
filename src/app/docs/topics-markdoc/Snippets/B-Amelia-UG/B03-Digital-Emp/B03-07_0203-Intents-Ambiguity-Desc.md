Define Amelia's behavior when the intent prediction is ambiguous. The top two scoring intents fall within the Intent Ambiguity Threshold setting. Configure this setting in NLU Comprehension > Settings (NLU Settings).

* Ask a Disambiguation Question: Select to let the user decide which intent to use. Amelia will ask a question and then proceed.

* Execute the Intent Directly: Amelia will execute the top scoring intent and ignore the ambiguity.
