This block lets you present a resource to your user as part of a conversation flow. One use of the Present block could be to showcase your Guest WiFi Rules (in PDF format) to visitors or guests. You can use files uploaded to Amelia's Content Manager or a locally stored variable pointing to an existing file. It's important to keep the resource's size under 50 MB. This ensures that the resource can be accessed and shared without any issues.

The Present block supports a range of file types, including:

* **Binary**: All file types, including executable files, compiled programs, SAS and SPSS system files, spreadsheets, compressed files, and graphic (image) files.

* **Office, Document, and Spreadsheet file**s: DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPS, PPT, PPTX, PPSX, KEY, PDF, ODS, ODT, RTF, and WPS.

* **Text files**: TXT, CSV, MD, and RTF.

* **Image file**s: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, SVG, EMF, BMP, WMF, PS, and EPS.

* **Audio files**: WAV, MP3, AC3, and OGG.
