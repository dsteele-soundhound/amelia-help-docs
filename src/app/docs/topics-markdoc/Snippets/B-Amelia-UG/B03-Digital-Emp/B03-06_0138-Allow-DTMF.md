Enabling this lets you use DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency) (dial tones) as user input.

Many speech-to-text providers support some form of DTMF detection, often through specific grammars. This field only applies to AVG-based DTMF detection. So, if you're using your speech-to-text provider to detect DTMF input, then set this field to false.
