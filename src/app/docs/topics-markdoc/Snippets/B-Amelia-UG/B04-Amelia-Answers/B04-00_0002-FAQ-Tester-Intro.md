To test Amelia's ability to respond in your configuration, you can engage Amelia in conversations. There are a few methods you can use to test Amelia's ability to process and use QA pairs in conversations. In some cases, these methods can also check Amelia's ability to infer context.

Don't let the different testing options confuse you. Remember, Tests looks at batches of questions and answers as XLSX files. And the Predict tool tests individual utterances.

Clicking the Tests button opens the Tests panel. The panel opens between the left-side menu and the Home page. Using the Tests panel, you can search for existing tests, open and edit tests, add new tests, or delete tests.
