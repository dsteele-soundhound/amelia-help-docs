Amelia gives weight to one or more words or an entire utterance. Use this setting to add or remove emphasis from text contained by the element. This element modifies speech like prosody but without the individual speech attributes.

Select the part of the utterance to emphasize, then click the Emphasis tab. From the Level dropdown, choose a selection and save.

* **None**: Applies no emphasis or stress to the utterance or selected part of the utterance.

* **Strong**: Emphasis is conveyed through various acoustic differences, including pitch, timing, and loudness, which vary according to the language being spoken.

* **Moderate**: Emphasis is conveyed through various acoustic differences, including pitch, timing, and loudness, which vary according to the language being spoken.

* **Reduced**: Effectively the opposite of emphasizing a word.
