<snippet id="Utterance-Intro_snippet">



The Utterance tab lets you define what Amelia says and how Amelia says it. Utterances can come from response pools or a specific phrase. You'll use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags to configure how Amelia speaks or delivers the utterance. For example, Amelia can deliver part of an utterance slowly or with more emphasis.
