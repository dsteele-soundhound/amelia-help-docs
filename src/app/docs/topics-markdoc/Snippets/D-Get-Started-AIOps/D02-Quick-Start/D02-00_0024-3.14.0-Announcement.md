A quick overview of what’s new in this release:

**Enhanced Control for AI-Driven Automation Generation**
This release introduces a new Automation Setting that gives users enhanced control over automation generation using generative AI. This feature allows you to manage when automations are created through the **Automate with AI** and **Resolve with AI** capabilities. With this update, users can:

* Manage when automations are created to reduce unwanted automations.
* Manually trigger automation creation to review the SOP before generation.

This enhancement empowers you to tailor the automation process, ensuring greater precision and compliance across your operations.

**Google Gemini 2.0 Model Support**
With this release, all existing functionality previously powered by Gemini 1.5 models (e.g., gemini-1.5-flash-002 and gemini-1.5-pro-002) will seamlessly transition to the improved Google Gemini 2.0 lineup. This ensures continued reliability while unlocking the full potential of Google’s next-generation AI models. Stay tuned as we continue to evolve our platform with cutting-edge AI technologies.

**New Outbound-Only SMTP Email Integration**
We are enhancing our email capabilities by adding outbound-only support through the SMTP protocol. This enables users to send automated emails via any standard SMTP server, thereby increasing flexibility and compatibility. The feature supports both unauthenticated and secure authentication, with optional encryption, and all credentials are managed securely within the platform’s credential store to comply with security and regulatory standards.

**Public and Private Comments for Tasks**

We’re introducing **public** and **private comments** to improve task collaboration and information control. This new feature enables users to set comment visibility based on login groups, maintaining transparency while protecting sensitive information.

Users can now classify comments as **public** (visible to all relevant stakeholders) or **private** (restricted to internal teams). Private comments are securely contained within the platform and are excluded from external integrations, email notifications, and ticketing systems, ensuring confidential data stays protected.
