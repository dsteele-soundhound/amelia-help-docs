Here's a brief look at what's included in this release:

**Filter Automation Executions by Automation Name**
We’re thrilled to unveil a new filtering feature that allows users to quickly narrow down execution records based on automation names. With this update, users can:

* Filter by automation name using a dynamically populated dropdown list.
* Select an automation to view only the relevant execution results.
* Quickly access frequently used automations, as the filter retains the five most recently selected automation names.

**Default Variable Values Now Visible in the Variable List**
Managing variables in the Automation Designer has become more straightforward. To enhance clarity and minimise unnecessary clicks, we’ve added a new ‘Default Value‘ column to the variable list. This enhancement provides users with immediate visibility into the default values of each variable, thus eliminating the need to open individual variable settings.

**Support for Payload-Based Authentication in Event and Metrics Endpoints**
To enhance compatibility with legacy systems, we’ve introduced payload-based authentication across all our event and metrics integration endpoints. This improvement addresses a significant limitation for systems that cannot set HTTP headers when sending external event payloads.

**Automations Lite support for Events and Performance Metrics**
To better support customers operating under strict network, security, or compliance constraints, we are enhancing the capabilities of our event and metrics integration endpoints by enabling them on the Automations Lite platform. This improvement increases flexibility and broadens the reach of our automation fabric to organisations with more tightly controlled environments, ensuring they can adopt our solutions without compromising policy adherence.

**Certificate-Based Authentication for HashiVault on Automations Lite**
To meet the evolving security needs of enterprise environments, Automations Lite now supports certificate-based authentication for integration with HashiVault. This enhancement builds on our existing support for HashiVault as a credential provider.

**Control Workflow Visibility in "New Task" View**
To enhance workflow management and minimise interface clutter, we’ve introduced the capability to specify the Task Type attribute as “None”, causing the workflow to vanish from the New Task view.

**Enhanced Date Variable Configuration with Custom Constraints and Defaults**
To provide greater flexibility and precision in workflow design, we’re introducing enhanced configuration options for date-type workflow variables. These updates enable users to define how and when date inputs are accepted, including whether past dates are permitted, calculating the offset of date and time, and how default values are established.
