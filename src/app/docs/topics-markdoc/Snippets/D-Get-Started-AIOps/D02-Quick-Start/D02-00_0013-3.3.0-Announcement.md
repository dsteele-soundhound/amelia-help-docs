Here's a brief look at what's included in this release:

* Version Control of Scripts allows users to track, revert, and manage different versions of their scripts, ensuring better control over changes and updates. Users can now see the history of each script, compare different versions, import, export and restore previous versions if necessary. This initial release is limited to scripts in the Script Library used by Automations.

   The primary purpose of this change was to enhance script management by providing a systematic way to track changes over time. This helps prevent the loss of important script versions, facilitates collaboration among team members, and ensures that users can easily revert to previous versions if a new change introduces errors or unintended consequences. This is a foundation for future integrations with version control systems like Git.

* Enhanced support for Tags enhances the powerful functionality for categorising, organising, and managing tasks in Amelia . They act as labels that can be assigned to almost any Amelia  artefact, enabling users to easily filter, search, and group related items. This capability is essential for improving efficiency, ensuring that tasks are completed organizationally, and helping users quickly access the information they need.

  Tags allow users to define specific criteria for automation selection and execution, ensuring that tasks are automatically processed when certain conditions are met. This saves time and reduces the risk of human error, leading to more reliable outcomes. Adding Tags to scheduled calendar events is an enhancement that integrates seamlessly with the existing automation and task management capabilities.

* Enhanced Reporting on connections made primarily by automations, is vital for maintaining security, compliance, and operational efficiency. By indexing connection logs in the platform's robust OpenSearch engine, organisations can gain deep insights into automationâ€™s connection activity, detect anomalies, generate comprehensive reports, and respond swiftly to potential security threats. This process enables the creation of detailed connection reports, visualisations, and alerts, enhancing an organisation's ability to monitor and secure automation accessing network assets.
