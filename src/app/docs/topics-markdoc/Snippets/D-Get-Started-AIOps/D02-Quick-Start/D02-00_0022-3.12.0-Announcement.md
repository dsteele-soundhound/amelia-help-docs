Here's a brief look at what's included in this release:

**Native Java Integrations** 
We're introducing support for deploying Custom Java integrations in the platform, including those based on Apache Camel, while retaining backwards compatibility with the Amelia Integration Framework. This allows Apache Camel integrations to run in the Cloud and on the Edge without any extra dependencies.

**Seamless ServiceNow CMDB Integration** 
With a few clicks, organisations can integrate ServiceNow's CMDB to streamline IT operations, ensuring accurate data synchronisation and flexible import options. Users can configure integrations, automate imports and map fields, and monitor statuses, with validation and notifications enhancing reliability.

**Extended Runtime Support** 
Users can configure an automation's execution location (Cloud or Edge), and any linked automation will inherit the parent automation's defined place of execution. If no Execution Group has been selected, the default setting for the Execution Group will be used for any automation running on the Edge.

**Command Timeout Exception Handling** 
With the new Show output on command timeout setting set to true, the command action will return error codes for soft and hard timeouts (-729/-730) together with captured output. Setting it to false (default) retains the current behaviour for backwards compatibility.

**Renaming Amelia AIOps to SoundHound AI Autonomics**
As part of our ongoing evolution, we’ve renamed the platform to SoundHound AI Autonomics. This change reflects the platform’s new capabilities and role in our product portfolio and ecosystem. As we advance, you’ll see this updated name reflected across our documentation, interfaces, and communications.

**Platform Resilience Update**
The SoundHound AI Autonomics platform now includes native support for authentication, authorisation, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). While this change does not affect user-facing behaviour, it strengthens platform independence and prepares for future flexibility. This change eliminates the previous dependency on SoundHound AI Amelia for managing identity and access, enabling the platform to independently:

* Authenticate users securely using internal login, LDAP and SAML2.
* Enforce access policies via built-in RBAC with an extended set of roles.
* Align more flexibly with evolving security and compliance requirements.

**Rich-text Editor for Task Comments**
We are enhancing Task Comments by introducing rich-text formatting options, moving beyond the simple text-based system. This feature allows users to create more expressive and structured comments using bold, underline, bullet points, code sections, and horizontal lines. With these improvements, providing detailed feedback and sharing code snippets becomes more efficient, ultimately helping to streamline task-related discussions.

**Enhanced Variable Support**
Automation now includes the ability to extract output into existing variables rather than being limited to creating new ones. Users can overwrite or append values, reducing unnecessary variable creation and improving log management. Additionally, variables can now be made without an initial assigned value, with the automation engine recognising them as empty. These enhancements provide more flexibility and efficiency in variable management.

**Consistent Action Focus across Automation Versions**
We’ve enhanced the experience when switching between automation versions. Previously, if you selected an action and switched to another version, the focus was lost, even if the same action existed in both versions. With our latest update, we retain focus on the selected action as long as it exists in the new version. This makes reviewing and comparing versions more seamless and efficient.

**Enhanced Processing of ServiceNow Knowledge Articles**
We are introducing enhanced processing capabilities that improve the rendering of HTML content using the ServiceNow Knowledge Integration. This update allows a broader range of safe HTML elements to be displayed while strictly filtering out potentially harmful tags. These improvements ensure a richer, more informative content display while maintaining security standards.
