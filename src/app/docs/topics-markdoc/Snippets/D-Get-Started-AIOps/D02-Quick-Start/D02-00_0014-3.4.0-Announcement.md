Here's a brief look at what's included in this release:

* **Expanded Task API: Enhanced Filtering & Management of Attachments**. The latest update to the Task API introduces powerful new capabilities for handling task attachments. Developers can now filter tasks based on the presence of attachments, retrieve detailed attachment information, and programmatically delete attachments through API endpoints. These enhancements provide greater flexibility for external applications, ensuring more efficient data management and improved control over sensitive information, complying with GDPR requirements.

* **New Setting for Automatic Attachment Deletion, Ensuring GDPR Compliance**. This feature introduces a new administrative setting that automatically deletes attachments for resolved tasks older than a specified number of days, complying with GDPR requirements. By default, this setting is disabled, ensuring no automatic deletions unless configured.

* **Enhanced Task History: Prioritizing Actor Name Display**. The task update history now prioritizes displaying the actor's name when available. If the name is not available, it will use the actor ID to retrieve and display the corresponding name. This improvement enhances clarity and provides better context for tracking task updates in the user interface.
