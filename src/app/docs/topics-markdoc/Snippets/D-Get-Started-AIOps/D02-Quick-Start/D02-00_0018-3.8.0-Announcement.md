Here's a brief look at what's included in this release:

**Google Gemini Support**
We are excited to announce that our platform now supports Google Gemini, further expanding Amelia Autonomics AI capabilities. This enhancement complements our existing support for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI, giving customers access to a broader range of advanced AI models.
By integrating Gemini, we aim to provide even greater flexibility and empower users to harness cutting-edge AI technologies tailored to their needs. Whether leveraging OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or Google Gemini, our Amelia Autonomics ensures seamless integration and optimal performance across all supported models.

**Import & Export of Scheduled Automations**
This release enhances our Content Pack format, adding scheduled artefacts such as automation to its already extensive support for Amelia Autonomics content. This enhancement provides a user-friendly graphical editor for selecting and adding planned automations that can be exported and imported into the target instance. It simplifies synchronising, sharing, and backing up calendar data across different Amelia Autonomics platforms.
