Version 3.1.0 introduces Summarise with AI, Webhooks and ServiceNow™ integration.

* AMELIA  generative AI’s Summarise with AI reliably and consistently provides accurate summaries. It ensures no important details are overlooked, giving engineers the confidence to tackle any issue. Accurate and consistent summaries help engineers make better-informed decisions by providing essential information at a glance when no automation is available to handle the task.

* Webhooks provide immediate notifications when an event occurs, ensuring that the application receives updates as soon as they occur and stays in sync in real time. This is crucial for applications that require up-to-date information. Webhooks support in AMELIA  liberates developers from the need to write complex polling mechanisms, making event integration straightforward.

* By embedding a Resolve with AI button in ServiceNow’s Incident GUI, engineers can quickly trigger Resolve with AI directly from the ServiceNow interface, using our new native integration with the platform.

* By embedding an Automate with AI button in ServiceNow’s Knowledge Article GUI, Automation Developers can quickly reference and incorporate the necessary standard operating procedures into their automation tasks from the Automation Workplace, triggered within a ServiceNow knowledge article.
