Here's a brief look at what's included in this release:

* **Announcement Of New Product Features:** Today, it is almost impossible to understand if and what has changed between releases -- it goes completely unnoticed. The release notes are the only place where users can ascertain what has changed between the two versions of our application, which isn't sufficient. From now on, users will be prompted with a list of key new features when logging in for the first time.

* **Quick Access to Recently Selected Clients:** In the previous version, client selection persistence was introduced across the Amelia Autonomics modules, streamlining workflow by eliminating the need to reselect a client when switching modules. Version 3.6.0 builds on this improvement by storing the ten most recently used clients, making it even easier for users to quickly access their frequently used clients and enhancing efficiency and usability.

* **New Dry-Run Feature for Content Pack Imports:** This release introduces a dry-run feature for Content Pack imports, allowing users to preview changes before importing. With this feature, teams can verify artefacts for compatibility and alignment, reducing the risk of errors and maintaining system stability. This additional step provides confidence in the import process and helps streamline implementation.

* **Improved User Experience for SOP Uploads to ServiceNow:** In last month's release, users gained the ability to upload generated Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) directly to ServiceNow. This release builds on that feature by refining the user experience and expanding access, making SOP uploads now available in the Automate with AI interface. These improvements streamline the process, offering users a more intuitive and versatile way to upload SOPs across the platform.

* **Passing Workflow Names as Variables:** This feature update allows users to pass workflow names as variables instead of relying on unique workflow IDs, simplifying deployment and reducing errors caused by ID changes during solution deployment. This improvement ensures smoother execution of sub-workflows without the need for hard-coded IDs, making workflow management more efficient and reliable.
