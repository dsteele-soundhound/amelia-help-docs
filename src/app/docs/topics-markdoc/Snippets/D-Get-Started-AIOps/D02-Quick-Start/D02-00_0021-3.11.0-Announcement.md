Here's a brief look at what's included in this release:

**Native Java Integrations** 
We're introducing support for deploying Custom Java integrations in the platform, including those based on Apache Camel, while retaining backwards compatibility with the Amelia Integration Framework. This allows Apache Camel integrations to run in the Cloud and on the Edge without any extra dependencies.

**Seamless ServiceNow CMDB Integration** 
With a few clicks, organisations can integrate ServiceNow's CMDB to streamline IT operations, ensuring accurate data synchronisation and flexible import options. Users can configure integrations, automate imports and map fields, and monitor statuses, with validation and notifications enhancing reliability.

**Extended Runtime Support** 
Users can configure an automation's execution location (Cloud or Edge), and any linked automation will inherit the parent automation's defined place of execution. If no Execution Group has been selected, the default setting for the Execution Group will be used for any automation running on the Edge.

**Command Timeout Exception Handling** 
With the new Show output on command timeout setting set to true, the command action will return error codes for soft and hard timeouts (-729/-730) together with captured output. Setting it to false (default) retains the current behaviour for backwards compatibility.
